   that             OpenAI has basically gone to everybody             and made them reliant on Open AI             surviving to pay the bills to keep their             stock up based on promises that Open AAI             has made publicly  And I&ll get back to             let get specific here  Let go        So, here&s what they do              Open AAI will give you  70 billion of             money it doesn&t really have and then             AMD will give you back    stock 10  of the             company which is currently valued at             around  34 billion  However, because             this has an announcement associated with                    it, holy OpenAI and AMD are             partnering and they&re going to build              70 billion worth of compute             announcement that caused    AMD&s    stock to             spike  So, if    AMD&s    stock continues to             rise, this 34 billion could easily             become around  70 billion         Which means             if OpenAI sells that stock, they             essentially got the GPUs and stuff for             free  They        get 70 billion worth of stock             to buy  70 billion worth of goods  No        all from the             outside investors  They&re they&re             basically making a big leverage bet that             news announcements around AI will cause             stock prices to rise  That is what is             going on here  I think I distilled this             in a previous video, but this one is        the             most concrete direct example  Like             OpenAI is only able to have this money             if this stock goes up in value  And the             only reason that happens is because they             know the announcement will do that  I I             don&        in one             line  And maybe for a billionaire that             is one line, but when the dust settles             is, you know, the entire stock market of             America is propped up on this AI spend              the the 401ks and retirements of like             every median American is probably on         of their collective wealth              Do you know like if that valuations were             to normalize would be such a disaster             not only the stock market and the             retirements but there&s so many like             again our economy right now is propped             up by the top end of      
    that it             otherwise wouldn&t be able to take              So, uh, Stargate, I mean, just             yesterday, we had a huge deal announced             between OpenAI and AMD             again like, well, let me not get ahead             of myself here, but uh, we&ll we&ll get             to it one by one  Stargate, stable        financial              world is working and the economy is              working  It&s why we see more and more              concentration              of you know um gains in the stock              market, wealth in the 1  and the              onetenth of 1  power in federal              governments,              central banks               Let&s see what&s on your mind                  the the sofur and              the uh the IOB rates and looking at              treasury auctions,              trying to understand better these deals              between OpenAI and Nvidia and AMD and              Oracle and SoftBank and              how they work so that we can look for              you know what would be the realworld              events and there will

                 did they change? What&s changed? Why              we&re not using Motorola processors              today? Why we&re not using Power PC              processors today? like why AMD              um now is is is is much more than than              when Intel than Intel like one Intel is              almost bankrupt  Why? What happened?              Intel was        decentralized              economy why it&s even interesting like              you buying with your with your I don&t              know u crypto uh you buy some Tesla              stock really what do you want that&s              what you want to do with crypto              like it&s like it&s like it&s like              putting

   capital,             and control  The first deal where AI             infrastructure itself becomes a             currency  Wall Street has never seen             anything like it  AMD&s    stock soared 30              in a single trading day, marking one of             the sharpest valuation jumps in             semiconductor history  Because well,             this deal gives        AMD what it&s been             chasing for years, a front row seat in             the AI boom long dominated by Nvidia              And        also, it gives OpenAI something even             bigger, independence  For years,             Nvidia&s hardware bottlenecks have             limited OpenAI&s ambitions  Now with             AMD&s Instinct Mi450 series powering             future models, OpenAI finally owns its             compute destiny  6 gawatt of compute              Well, that&s more power than some        countries consume  Each phase of this             buildout from MI450 deployment to             nextgen energy partnerships will             redefine what AI infrastructure even             means  AMD and OpenAI will work with             hyperscalers like Oracle Cloud, nuclear             energy providers, and modular data             center operators to make this possible              This        of its supplier  Nvidia owns a             piece of OpenAI  It&s actually circular             capitalism, a feedback loop of             investment, innovation, and             interdependence  AMD gets guaranteed             multi-year demand worth billions  OpenAI             gets leverage, early access, and             preferred pricing  This is not just a             partnership  This is        ecosystems  Chat GPT apps             put productivity inside conversations              Agent Kit turns every user into a             creator  Codeex automates software             itself  And now AMD powers it all  So             what&s actually the result? OpenAI             controls the full stack from interface             to silicon  And of course joining us                   Nvidia which              actually brings me to this fact and this              would have definitely uh helped as far              as AMD&s uh excitement and positivity is              concerned because well the    stock jumped              over 30  as we discussed post              announcement its biggest rally in years               So well, do        you see this rally Romesh as              a sustainable rerating of AMD&s AI              potential or just speculative euphoria?              Because while investors celebrate,

   thing going  As guys, in my            opinion, the charts look really bullish             We have to go over where I see this uh            the stock going, how the setup is            looking right now, and overall what I&m            looking to do  And we&ll cover some            other stocks       of the gains, some profit taking as             expected  Uh but now it&s up 4   We&re             pushing back up, guys, around 4   AMD is             at 211 212  And I got a question             yesterday  I actually answered it on um             on Tik Tok  Make sure you guys go       100K platform is here on YouTube,             guys  Make sure to subscribe um and             follow along for more  But look, I got a             question  AMD on    AMD Stas, will it ever             go under  200 again? Or actually, no, it             wasn&t a question  It was a statement             now that I        think about it  It was like,             Stace, AMD is never going to go under              200 again  And I was like, be careful             with that, you know? Although, we did             get a        in trouble when they&re when             they throw the word never around when it             comes to the stock market  You know what             I mean? It&s like, come on, it&s the                stock market  Anything is possible              Never say never  Have we not learned             anything at this point        in time? Um, so             yeah, couldn&t uh could AMD go under             200? Absolutely it could  Um, especially             now that we&        but it&s going to             end up bringing AMD down and overall             more profit taking could occur here  you             know, don&t don&t be naive to that  Uh             that there are a lot of people that were             buying the       down and overall             more profit taking could occur here  you             know, don&t don&t be naive to that  Uh             that there are a lot of people that were             buying the stock in the 70s,8s,  100 a             share         People are going to start locking             in those gains  You know, people were             buying the stock months ago and now             they&ve doubled their money in less than             half a year  More profit taking could be             on the horizon       200, it won&t             last long  Uh but to say never, don&t             say never, guys  Don&t say never  But             yeah, AMD looking very good on the day              Uh Netflix is starting to rebound as             well  We got some words from uh from             Elon on X        around Netflix  The stock             tanked  Uh but now we&re starting to get             back up over 2  or we&re right around 2              in the green  Um      
   trading under the ticker           symbol INTC on the NASDAQ is currently           experiencing a dynamic session  As of           11:59 a m  Eastern time, the stock is           trading at  36 78,            reflecting a modest intraday gain of            0 63              This subtle upward movement, however,            belies a much       and a curse  The market has            evolved at a blistering pace and Intel            has by its own admission stumbled  The             rise of competitors like AMD in the CPU             market and the explosion of GPUdriven             artificial intelligence, a domain where             Nvidia reigns supreme, have             fundamentally altered the competitive       between the             old perception and the new reality is             paramount  Today&s trading session is a             microcosm of this broader struggle  The             stock&s movement is being influenced by             a confluence of factors  On one hand,             there&s a palpable sense of optimism             stemming from the        optimistic narrative  Platforms like             Interactive Brokers, which cater to more             sophisticated traders, are undoubtedly             seeing a surge in activity around Intel             stock as hedge funds and other large             players position themselves for this             potential long-term payoff  However, on             the other hand, there are significant         market dominance  The reality is a             long, arduous and capitalintensive             journey with no guarantee of success  A             crucial aspect of Intel&s recent stock             movement is its deep integration with             the broader macroeconomic environment              The semiconductor industry is             notoriously cyclical and concerns about          of             its next generation chips could lead to             a significant resurgence in the             company&s fortunes and a substantial             appreciation in the Intel stock price              In this version of the future, Intel not             only reclaims its leadership in the CPU             market, but also becomes a major        segments              This would be a significant blow to the             company and would likely lead to a             prolonged period of stagnation for the             Intel stock  The risks are substantial,             but so are the potential rewards  This             is the central tension that is driving             the current debate among        investor should             be watching closely  The interplay             between Fidelity wealth management             strategies and the volatile nature of             tech stocks like Intel and Nvidia stock             highlights the need for a nuanced             approach to online investing  Whether             you are using a sophisticated platform             like Interactive Brokers or a

Because             Open AI has pledged to AMD  So, are you             still going to give a h 100red billion             to Open AI?

   a            lot of stocks out there that I love, but            the multiples are too expensive, like            Robin Hood with a 50 plus forward PE,            AMD with the 50 plus forward PE, SoFi             So, there&s a lot of really expensive            companies, but I&m going to recommend            some companies        ?             We go to their total  Actually, this is             the number you want to look at, the             diluted weighted average shares  That             includes uh stock options and stuff like             that  It&s better than the total comma             shares outstanding  But check this out              In the most recent quarter, there is        year, another 3  this year  So,             they&re going crazy on the share             buybacks  They&ve slowed it down a             little bit because the stock has been uh             so high and a little bit expensive, but             it&s finally come down to a good             valuation where I think they&re       dividend, and the yield is pretty low,             but here&s the thing  They also pay a             yearly special dividend  It&s pretty             cool  And this stock is well off alltime             highs  You know, uh all-time highs was             290  Now it&s 240  This is an insurance             company  And again,       million              That&s when they paid the special             dividend  So that&s pretty cool  Uh             that&s what I just really like about             this stock  So anyway, they&re             shareholder friendly  They&re in a guys             they&re in a nice industry and the the             revenue keeps growing  Their        margins are             expanding  Let me actually double check             their margin real quick  Then we&ll get             to the last stock here  But yeah, look             at their net margin  14   Look at it&s             never been 14  before  That was a record             margin  I         stocks             that don&t do good in a bull market like             the safety stocks progressive grocery             stores all right guys for this last             stock here this is one I see nobody ever             talk about but in my opinion this is the             best drink company they actually sell             beer        a             little bit more of this company I bought             uh let me see right here I bought three             shares for I bought  150 of this stock a             few days ago  So, let me tell you why I             bought more of this company  They&re a             phenomenal dividend growth dividend                   with             the share buybacks, the huge yield              Again, I don&t I don&t expect this             company to outperform in the long run              This stock is the same price that it was             back in 2014  Yikes  So, do beware  But             the share buybacks and the dividends             look attractive and those      
   to              highlight that for everybody one more              time  Um five bucks uh a month  Pretty              cheap  Uh come on AMD, let&s go  So,              yeah  I mean, I love the    stock  Uh as              there it is               I mean, I don&t know if it&s I don&t              know                     today               &gt;&gt; Ask Perplexity               &gt;&gt; I&m not doing that  Uh Perplexio will              just won&t give any answers about stock              prices  So, uh but anyways, nice move              there uh for    AMD on the back end of that              trade  So, if you like the short, I mean              the shorts here, Obie  I       here               saying this is a great look for the               space  It&s a great look for the stock                And then also too, uh, Jeffrey&s               actually had some other positive things               about    AMD beyond the deal that I think               probably worth going over here  They               lifted the company&s                       obi and tanked  Went back to VWOP and               tanked again  So, AMD,               I look, I don&t want to say the emperor               has no close here because    AMD made came               close to all-time highs,               but this    stock will fall back in a               little bit  That move yesterday was 25                     back               to the upside there on TSLA  So, uh,               that&s going to be my number one                Actually, my number one P&amp;L stock still               is    AMD actually  Uh, we we we had a               great run there on Advanced Micro               Devices and we we were loaded up  So,               that was        we could               trade back down there, which would be               nasty if that does happen  So, I&d say               watch out for AMD  For now, I like the                  stock, but I do worry about Open AI                They&re not making any money  They&re               making all these deals  A hundred                     and it was 10 for               Nvidia                &gt;&gt; So a little bit of a lower deal there               with AMD but again we like the    stock               with open AI uh deal here  What do you               think about    AMD?               &gt;&gt; I mean yeah like I think from an               intraday perspective to get for trading               for        Thank you so               much for joining  You can check our               bumper at the bottom  Find him on Stock               Twits  Find him on X as well  Uh Brian,               we got that crazy move in    AMD just a               couple days ago  Um and and since then,               although it was up 4  today,       and then uh that&s I mean                80 a premium or something on an option                Like that was an absolute crazy stock               there  But let&s look forward on    AMD,               right? I mean I so so I look at here on               the daily chart and if we could flip               over      
    yield roughly 20             to 30   But target positions are not             new, I should say  But we have quite a             few funds here  We have AI, AMD, AMZN,             COIN or Coin, MARA, MSTR, Nvidia, PLTR,             SMCI, and Tesla  No surprise here  Some             of their absolute best performers in the             group so far        one of the             best  MSTR was very popular for a long             time and still is, but has fallen off              And then we have others, Coinbase, AMD,             AMZN, Amazon, which is probably a little             bit slower  But the goal with these is             interesting because a target 25 fund is             I can see        cash distribution level             of 25   And capital appreciation  So             it&s going to combine synthetic long             exposure uh to the common stock  This is             the AI one for C3 AI common    stock of AI             and the use of option strategies             designed to generate premiums of that             25   So,             it&s an interesting        stuff like that  And then             we go into the next one which is let&s             see is this Amazon I can&t even find it              AMD  So    AMD is cheaper at 1 23   23               But guys, I I struggle to see who&s             going to pay 1 23   I know people will      
     We did            start with a shell, but ended up using            nothing but the roof on it, and built            the rest of it out of the AMD catalog             In this case, the car actually found me             So, I had a gentleman give me a call and            want a price on building a        off of the rack, get it             down on the ground  Now, this car had             all original Dodge Charger sheet metal              And while I love my AMD, I love and we             use it all the time  We couldn&t put             these cars together without it  It&s             about one in every hundred        was             being built, not when it&s time to             paint  You know, I did forget about             adding the subframe connectors  Okay,             it&s not a stock piece that these cars             got  I forgot about it  But this is a             this is a great example of how, you             know, we&ll sit        some really nice B-roll of             this thing before he destroyed it              Well, what are you going to do?             This is a new old stock  New old    stock              That&s me after 3 minutes              God, this thing&s made it 90 years and             you had it for 30 seconds and destroyed             it      
   , in this video,            we&re going to go over why we called the            bottom and how you can replicate this            across any trade or any stock that you            are currently watching  where I think            Clean Spark is headed in the next couple            of days and more importantly where I            think this                    that area of interest is to buy  But             more importantly, it&s going to normally             be the lowest that we&re going to see             the stock pull back to because             institutions are going to step in when             they&re getting that significant of a             discount  So understanding this, let&s             look        low, we walk away from the             position  Now obviously price ends up             bouncing and breaking out massively              Since we called that smart money zone,             the stock is now up over 94               And I need you to understand that we&re             not just cherrypicking this  For             instance, one of the best trades        we&ve             had this summer was Reddit following the             same system  AMD following the same             system, Robin Hood following the same             system, Zeta following the same system,             Soundhound, it goes on and on  Now, the             reason that      
   , Open AAI took a 10  stake in              AMD  Here&s how circular is  So, first              off, Nvidia bought a 100red billion of              Open AAI and Open AAI now owns 10  of                     Here&s how circular is  So, first              off, Nvidia bought a 100red billion of              Open AAI and Open AAI now owns 10  of              AMD  and OpenAI just bought a bunch of                 AMD chips which is sending    AMD stock up               So whenever    AMD stock goes up that&ll              send OpenAI        stock up which will then              send Nvidia    stock up  So indirectly the              circle is completed now  A Nvidia    stock              benefits from    AMD stock going up because              OpenAI owns it        and Nvidia has a stake in              OpenAI  Pretty crazy  I I&m going to              make a video about that later  But um              anyway, AMD is one I do own  I I&m not              really        a 100red billion of              Open AAI  So, check this out right here               Open AAI buys a bunch of AMD chips  That              sends    AMD stock up  But since OpenAI              owns    AMD shares, Open AAI    stock goes up              because    AMD goes up  Well, Nvidia has a              stake in Open AI  So, literally, I kid              you not, now Nvidia        stock goes up              whenever    AMD stock goes up  So, the              circle&s now completed  But, uh, yeah,              pretty cool     AMD is now like, &quot;Hey,              OpenAI, the best AI company in the              world, uses our chips  Everyone buy        our              stuff &quot; It&s a great marketing thing               I&m up a million because of AMD  Heck              yeah, dude        want me to              look at for the last one, uh, let me              know  Um, so AMD stock, you know,              basically Open AAI now has a 10  stake              in    AMD and Nvidia has a hundred billion              stake in OpenAI  So, we&re seeing a              little bit of a circular motion here,              you know  Um       , Nvidia is literally now              going up in stock price because    AMD              stock is going up because they own a                 stock in Open AI  Kind of crazy, but uh,              yeah               Um, let me pull this up right here  So              the basically      
    for the           event  When we do, of course, we&ll           update the the calendar and put out the           video            So, just some just seeing here AMD            shares rising 7 3             extending gains into second day  This is            in regards to what Tesla could be            expected to unveil today  They could be                   expected to unveil lower cost Model Y in            push to reignite sales             So AMD rising about 7 2  after Jeffrey&s            after Jeff upgrades to buy several            brokerages to raise target price of                  rising about 7 2  after Jeffrey&s            after Jeff upgrades to buy several            brokerages to raise target price of            stock as well             IBM shares up to spot 3  after company            announced his strategic partnership with            Anthropic      
    next couple of             days  I do have some funds coming my             way  I&ll feel happy about it  The             update  yesterday about the AMD              Remember we were talking about that and             I thought this was pretty awesome  I             don&t know if who posted this, but             somebody        did  Um, just two trading days             ago, somebody bought  6 million worth of             calls on AMD, which is super unusual,             right? Super unusual   6 million in             calls  And bam, they&re up 300   They             turned uh, you know, they        sitting on the sidelines with              private equity,              &gt;&gt; private credit  So, the biggest form              next year into a market that&s already              hot  The stock market&s flying  There&s              lots of money sitting on the sidelines              with private equity, private credit  So,              the biggest challenge I think that we       at all?              &gt;&gt; You know, it&s interesting  Like I said              earlier, we&ve got a unique situation              right now  We&ve got a stock market              that&s trading at, you know, 27 times              PE  you know, average over the years 17              18 times  So, by any stretch        whatever the              hell his name was who didn&t know t know how this market              actually works  They keep talking about              stock  They keep talking about options               They keep talking about leverage and              they&re not understanding what              requirements are, the requirements from              private       burning  Oh man,              I wonder when the price will reflect the              warrants  Ah, who knows?              If I&m very bullish on the stock, can I              buy T-Rex ETF for the long run?

    desastre y esto             ya no lo niega nadie, ¿vale? Son un             desastre  el retiro intempestivo del             stock de la consola en grandes cadenas             comerciales  Es decir, se han comido             Microsoft se ha comido muchísimo    stock             de CSS y Series X que no se ha vendido              Esto impulsaría una inclinación total             hacia los       dispositivos Xbox propios,             diseñados y construidos por nosotros,             para obtener más detalles, la comunidad             puede revisar nuestro anuncio  de             acuerdo con AMD  Sí, puede ser  Yo creo             que van a sacar algo, pero están ahí              Eh, la duda está ahí y esto, como digo,             ahora pueden decir      
   &s the same thing, right? My strategy              I told you, right? It works not only in              the futures, it is going to work in the              stock  It is going to work in the              options  In fact, in the options, if the              timing is nailed properly with our              levels, why not? Hit        like so far I&m just giving              those you know top eight tech stocks but              ideally I would like to give few more              names like AMD is moving these days coin              other thing they have asked is Palenteer              I just don&t have time to you know go              through that much       know we can never tell               right what the reaction would Okay,               maybe tomorrow it rallies 7  again                This is crazy, right? The manipulations               in that stock are crazy                I don&t know guys, you know, people               write off Tesla and then it rallies, you               know, 50 60  just like that                You        can never write off that stock  It&s               a very crazy, you know, volatile and can               do anything anytime, right? It is just a               tweet away  If they announce something,               it      
    same like do you              get the same kind of requests for people              who want quiet stuff or are they just              all undervolting whatever the the stock              hardware is?              &gt;&gt; We actually do pretty good with quiet              stuff  Um we quiet though really gets              misunderstood in this industry  How so?              &gt;&gt;       end  Uh Sapphire was              founded to work with ATI               &gt;&gt; That was the goal  In fact, a lot of ATI              products before the the merger with AMD,              a lot of them were actually made by              Sapphire               &gt;&gt; Yeah               &gt;&gt; The reference boards back in the day              were Sapphire boards like many boards      they              like, &quot;Ah, you know, you know, may maybe              not &quot;              &gt;&gt; That&s above my pay grade               &gt;&gt; That&s above my pay grade               &gt;&gt; Yeah               &gt;&gt; AMD doesn&t ask me squat               &gt;&gt; Yeah  Well, and and obviously they&re              not stopping you from doing it  Uh I              just didn&t know, you                     it it it&s like a dog with a bone,              they&re not going to let go of it  It              doesn&t m Look at AMD  AMD has suffered              for              the last 10 years with the stigma of bad              drivers               And the truth is, what is it about              eight, nine        Teslaization was really              taking off?              &gt;&gt; Witcher 3               &gt;&gt; Witcher 3               &gt;&gt; Yeah  Yeah               &gt;&gt; And              and man, Witcher 3 ran like crap on AMD              video cards  It was awful  But the hair              flow was so beautiful on Nvidia cards               And then they discovered something               Nvidia had had CCP take        land parties               &gt;&gt; All have you got the then you&ve got the              Reddit Discord group               &gt;&gt; Some Discord groups are okay  I&m on the              AMD discord and there&s actually a              pretty good crew over there               &gt;&gt; You should come to the full nerd              discord  We we got a great              &gt;&gt; I       show, Ivanar, has two questions  One is,              since Sapphire is blue, should we expect              ARC GPUs coming soon?              &gt;&gt; Well, no, we&re Sapphire  We&re AMD               &gt;&gt; Okay  Uh, second question is, is              Sapphire disappointed that there is no              9080 XT?              I I think everybody&s a little              disappointed there&s      clearly presented, this would make it              super easy for consumers to do this  And              then I remember three months later they              abandoned it               Um,              AMD&s got some work they need to do on              this  That&s the most I can say about              that without really making people upset               &gt;&gt; Okay      
    bit             about that, but he did say look might be             1999 right now, but he then also said,             look, it took a while, right? The stock             market doubled until until 2000 when it             popped  Now, what&s interesting here as             well is that five years ago, January             2020, this was a         Why Paul Tutor             Jones says the markets remind him a lot             of early 1999              Yesterday we&ve got this investor Paul             Tutor Jones says the stock market today             feels exactly like 1999              So             yeah, but that said those are quite             aggressive titles because he he does             have some solid reasons behind       2000, NASDAQ did double              So, you might say that before we reach a             a top, we might see suddenly a huge huge             increase in the stock market              Yeah, but we&ve already seen that huge             increase this year and last year and and             two years ago  Well, to counter that             argument        can go and look at the S&amp;P             500  Let&s go all the way back to 2020,             right? So, in 2020, of course, the stock             market crashed quite heavily, quite fast             because of the Corona virus  So, it went             down 36  in a matter of a couple of             weeks  Now                Again, those are rumors and reports  And              that&s pure upside for Oscar because the              guidance currently does not include any              extension of the subsidies  AMD is up              another 4  after effect of yesterday&s              announcement  Lots of price target              raised as well  Hims is up a little bit               PayPal is        to happen again  But I can see              the huge difference, right? A Google,              for example, it&s not expensive today              even with the rise in stock price               PayPal is not expensive today  Alibaba              is not expensive  You might say that              Sofa is expensive  I don&t think it is               were far      
   guys? It&s Graham here            And if you have any money in the market           whatsoever, you need to hear this           because despite the stock market           breaking all-time highs, search volume           for AI bubble has just broken a new           record  Investors believe that the            economy is now                  But wait, if that sounds like a circular            infinite money glitch, it gets even             weirder  Open AAI also owns 10  of AMD              Intel will be partnering with    AMD as a             customer, and the government owns 10  of             Intel  Or basically, to dumb this down,             it&s kind of like        again, that&s just the very beginning              We also have a metric called the Buffett             indicator which measures the total value             of the stock market against the US GDP              And he&s previously referred to it as             the single best measure of where             valuations stand at any given       see here,             the Buffett indicator is trading at an             above trend price of 217               Which places it at the highest level             ever recorded in stock market history              Of course, in fairness, these days, the             Buffett indicator is set to be somewhat             flawed because it doesn&t take into         I&m doing and how             to prepare going forward, no matter what             happens, we got to answer the question,             are we in a stock market bubble, the             honest answer is by nearly every             measurable aspect  There&s just no way             to sugarcoat it, the market is trading         the dollar was rising or falling  Of             course, that&s not to say that the             dollar can&t have some impact in the             stock market shortterm, but long-term,             it&s shown that the dollar&s moves             really have zero correlation with the             S&amp;P 500&s performance                   have some effect, right? Well, to a             certain degree, yes, inflation can be             factored into the price that you pay for             a stock  But over the long run, when you             really dig into the data, there&s no             correlation between the amount of money             getting printed into        involves backward-looking data  But even             if you did some sort of look ahead,             there&s nothing there  This all suggests             that the stock market is genuinely             expanding outside of the amount of money             that gets printed into the economy  So,             does this confirm then that we&re        longer than you could remain             solvent  This means that as smart as you             think you might be to predict the future             and call a stock market bubble, the             market has shown that it&s consistently             defied the odds and betting against it             so far has been very unprofitable  Like      
    people who take it             super seriously and they always have             their own ">stock stuff is is             it&s it&s garbage  It&s, you know, it&s             been through the ringer              Sure  Sure  Sure  Sure  I&m trying        nextG              thing  Uh there&s been some back and              forth about this  Xbox did come out and              point out, hey, we have a deal with AMD              to make a system on a chip for our next              hardware  We are going to we&re still in              this  Now, what exactly does that        the s              called  Um, this is separate from that               Uh, there was rumors about why that was              cancelled  And it&s because apparently              AMD was like, &quot;Hey, we&ll make you this              chip, but you have to guarantee you&ll              buy 10 million of them &quot; And Xbox was              like        part of the story is not true               Although I imagine it&s this thing right              here where it&s like AMD demanded 10              million chips  That sounds not right to              me because    AMD has definitely made fewer              chips for that for people before  But              maybe something about this requires so              much effort      
    year of red, there&s             three years of green, right? The market             is created to go up  Right? I need you             to understand this  The stock market is             created to go up  So if the average bare             market lasts for one year and the             average bull market lasts for three             years        not going             to really understand this  But this is             why you got to go in the charts and go             look at April  Look at every stock for             the most part inside of April, right?             And I want you to look at the price of             that        stock in April  And I want you to             look at it right now  Okay?             So now let&s talk about let&s look at             the charts         well  Am I saying stay in a trade             just because? No  What I&m saying is you             got to be able to understand where the             stock is at, what&s going on with it off             the daily time frame, right? If you&re             swing trading a month out, two months             out        back to um here              Right  So, they they were at  71 and             they ended up coming down to 61  That&s             pretty substantial for a stock trading             at  70 a share, right? And they did that             in one, two, three, four, five days              Okay  So, if you would have gotten to       &t have to go as far to be             able to be in the profit              Does that make sense? Um, it we can look             at any stock, right? Look at Dale  It             just did the same thing, right? Pulled             back right here, right? And then look,             this is support  And then right        was way higher             than where it just came down to at 141              2 days later, it was at 155  Right? Um,             look at look at AMD, right? If we go to             the daily,             right? Retracements  This is what I&m             talking about  retracements              Okay  Um, we sold off right here, right        just to uh, you know, shake             people out and get people a afraid  But             you have to understand that when you see             like a quality stock and it sold off by             five, 7  in one and two days, what             they&re doing is they&re trying to bring             the        stock down so that the institutional             investors can buy into that    stock and             then shoot it right back up to retrace             where it just went from              All right  So, listen y&all

   again, because what just happened            this week has completely rewritten the            story  Just days after Nvidia struck a            high-profile partnership with OpenAI,            AMD announced a massive 5-year deal with            Sam Alman&s AI powerhouse that could            reshape the entire computing landscape             The deal covers 6 GW of       that Open AI isn&t just             a customer  It&s also a potential             shareholder through performance-based             warrants allowing up to 10  ownership in             AMD  That&s long-term alignment, not             short-term hype  Lisa Sue summed it up             perfectly  Every gigawatt of compute             represents double-digit billions        in             revenue  And this is just the beginning              AMD&s open software ecosystem, Rockm is             gaining traction as developers seek             alternatives to NVIDIA&s closed CUDA             framework  A move that could broaden the                     years of strategic             investment in AI infrastructure from CPU             GPU fusion chips to advanced packaging             technologies  And now the world is             catching up  AMD is no longer playing             catch-up  It&s co-leading the race  And             in an economy where AI demand is             outpacing supply, that&s       up             is Super MicroMut, ticker symbol SMCI,             the company transforming from a server             manufacturer into the architect of the             world&s AI factories  While AMD and             Nvidia design the chips, Super Micro             builds the systems that house, cool, and             scale them into entire data centers  And             right now,                   meet local demand and navigate trade             uncertainties  Analysts expect the             company to hit   33 billion in revenue             by 2026, powered by Blackwell and AMD             Instinctbased systems  It&s no longer             accurate to call Super Micro a server             maker  It&s now the engineer of AI             infrastructure itself         company on our list is helping tech             giants build custom AI brains  Chips             that think faster, cheaper, and smarter             than ever before  The third stock on our             list is Marvel Technology, ticker symbol             MRVL, a company rapidly becoming one of             the unsung heroes of the AI revolution              While most       top  In its latest quarter, data             center revenue jumped 69              year-over-year, confirming that AI             demand is fueling strong momentum  While             Nvidia and AMD dominate the headlines,             Marvel is quietly ensuring that AI             systems don&t just exist, they connect,             scale, and perform seamlessly  As custom             AI       
    have seen this pattern for years              FTDs, failures to deliver massive             activity in dark pools, and other hidden             trading tactics designed to keep the             stock from reflecting its true value              Interestingly, retail is responding in             the exact opposite way that shorts             intended  Instead of giving up and             selling when      before              Imagine being up hundreds of millions,             maybe even billions in profit, but being             too trapped to close because closing out             would send the stock soaring  That&s             where shorts are stuck right now, in a             prison of their own making              And remember, those 555 million             unsettled shares are       ,             because AMC distributed the film, the             company profited directly, too  That&s a             double win  And yet, despite this             record-breaking release, AMC stock was             pushed down nearly 4  that day  Does             that make sense? Of course not  That&s             not real market logic  That&s             manipulation at       you may have seen             reports that tens of thousands of Robin             Hood users were suddenly locked out of             their accounts during a major surge in             AMD stock  AMD jumped more than 30              pre-market after signing a huge deal             with Open AI  But instead of retail             investors benefiting, a broker outage                     new             GameStop warrant  Think about the             pattern  Whenever events unfold that             could benefit retail, whether it&s AMC,             GME, or another heavily shorted stock,             technical glitches just happen to             appear  We&ve seen this movie before              Remember the times when AMC&s market cap             or outstanding shares would        &t risk outages and bad             publicity at brokerages just to stop             retail from buying              AMC&s fight is bigger than just a movie             theater stock  It represents retail             investors holding strong in the face of             Wall Street&s most aggressive games              Institutions know this  That&s why             they&       re accumulating  That&s why shorts             are trapped  And that&s why despite all             the noise, AMC continues to be a             battleground stock with one of the             strongest retail communities in the             market              So the question you have to ask yourself             is this  If banks are quietly        what does that tell             you about AMC&s real potential?             Guys, that&s all we have for you today              What is your opinion about AMC stock?

If you        bass  I&m             happy with the standard sound system  It             sounds great  But now, as far as tech             goes, I mean, you still get that AMD             Ryzen chip  It&s still super responsive,             super fast  You can charge at Tesla             superchargers  There&s nothing weird             about that  No way to fold

    show you             the layout  So, AI tweaker, this is             where memory and CPU overclocking             happens at advanced  This is where             system configuration and AMD specific             settings are located at  Monitor is just             hardware monitoring and fan control              Boot is just boot options and secure             boot settings  What I         But the 900X3D, no way  Modern             games and productivity tasks need those             threads and often have weird micro             stutters when disabling S&amp;T on AMD  So,             turbo game mode stays off as we could do             the rest of the settings it does             manually              Now, let me show you       a normal             person and you use a graphics card,             disable the integrated graphics to avoid             issues and reduce latency  Go back, go             to AMD CBS, and I like disabling global             sestate control  I&ve seen plenty of             people recommending it to leave auto or             enabled  For my testing        yes  And then just click save             changes and reset              Now, here&s what I want to show you  the             actual performance differences between             stock BIOS settings and our optimized             configuration  I ran some tests before             we started this optimization  So, let&s             let me show you the difference our        BIOS             optimization makes in actual games  In             Call of Duty Black Ops 6 at 1080p, stock             BIOS settings give us 321 average FPS,             1  low of 263  Frame times were             inconsistent with some stuttering  Now,             with optimized BIOS settings       smooth, consistent frame times              That&s a 47 FPS improvement, nearly 15              better performance just from BIOS             optimization, and without any             overclocking  Stock BIOS settings in             Fortnite at 1080p, average FPS 993 7,             1  low 595  Lots of frame drops during             builds and explosions  Optimized BIOS             settings,                   optimized, which I&m currently running             my optimized Windows, Fortnite runs             great on stock BIOS for these PC specs             with the new performance mode  However,             legacy performance mode has a lot of             stutters on    AMD Radeon GPUs  The memory             optimization and precision boost             overdrive settings are doing exactly             what       and gaming             performance that&s absolutely crushing             it  This is exactly the level of             optimization I bring to every client             system  The difference between stock             settings and proper tuning is massive              We&re talking 10 to 15  performance             improvements just from BIOS             configuration  What do you think of this      
   a           point that Colt brought up in his video,           is that they could very easily be           leveraging these chips that they&re           making with AMD for their cloud servers            And when they say that they&re committed            to firstparty hardware, well,            technically a server rack is firstparty            hardware        a point that             Colt brought up in his video, is that             they could very easily be leveraging             these chips that they&re making with AMD             for their cloud servers  And when they             say that they&re committed to firstparty             hardware, well, technically a server             rack is first        of hey they already signed              the contracts right the next gen Xbox              they already made an official              announcement they&ve signed deals with              AMD AMD is making the chipset inside the              new system now the reason I don&t mind              the idea of them backing out the way                                  and lead lawsuits and stuff is when              there&s like a shortage, when you leave              somebody high and dry  Whereas right              now, honestly, AMD chips are in very,              very, very high demand  I bet Microsoft              offered them a lot of money to buy, you              know, 10 million        of these, 20 million of              these to massproduce these consoles  And              maybe they told AMD, hey, we&re not              doing it anymore  I don&t think    AMD              would be that mad because those chips              are still already essentially pro  Those              chips are still going to        go other              places  other companies  Chips go in              everything from your phones to your cars              to everything  So, I don&t think that              AMD is going to be like that pissed if              they say, &quot;Oh, okay  So, these chips are              going to China instead of going to                     Microsoft &quot; They&re still going to get              sold  AMD is not that buttth hurt  But              here&s the next thing  A new Xbox              console was supposed to be out by 2026,              but this        t even              care  It&s clear that they&re willing to              just give up everything for a 1  share              price increase of freaking Microsoft              stock  Yeah  I mean, that&s the thing,              too, with me and like the hatred for              like the Switch 2, for example  It&s        quiet              cancellations is the sad end of Xbox               Dude, I wish I had some of these near              me  I would buy up the entire stock               I don&t think they can make a comeback               I don&t think that Xbox games are going              to be as profit                     
                consist of the MI the MI450s              That is a lot of moola  Um in return uh             OpenAI is getting 160 million shares of             AMD priced at uh 1 cent and these are             actually warrants  Uh so it&s warrants             for 160 million shares  So what is that             like       years I think they&re pretty much in the             clear that those that is that is the             assumed dilution  Uh the question is um             is AMD going to 300?             And the next question is who&s going to             benefit from this? Right? And I think             the price action from        today pretty much             tells you exactly who&s going to benefit             from it  Meanwhile AMD is still up over             20  today  I mean, that&s no that&s no             joke, right? Um certainly heading toward              300, but uh       were not above that during the             cash session, I believe  Uh, need to             confirm that one  So, yeah  Uh, happy             for your three shares of AMD  So, yeah,             good  Congratulations  Hey, listen  That             means those three shares went up 20  or             more today  So, you got to be happy         1 million  So, that&s a lot of              people looking at that stuff               &gt;&gt; See, look, look at this person  Not this              guy&s like AMD Helios rack stacking MI              blah blah blah  Okay, great               &gt;&gt; But guess what? The ones that are in the              facility that OpenAI showed were SMCI1          to go, right?              &gt;&gt; If you think about you were just              discussing the racks for OpenAI and how              they&re using uh well those are AMD              racks, right? But let&s think about              let&s let&s think about what Super Micro              actually does, right? They build racks              and       their business, right? They want              to build those racks because it includes              everything  It includes Nvidia chips  In              this case, it might include the AMD              chips and so on  And we are in a Pix and              Shovel secular theme right now where              everything with Pix and Shovels is              ripping,        to              basically be adding on 2 gigawatts  And              then you have all these Stargate deals              coming out  And you have this one with              AMD and OpenAI  And you have even more              happening within with Nebius and uh with              Nebius and Microsoft  And then you have              all these people        don&t know  It&s pretty crazy just like              kind of think about that, right? Kind of              crazy  Um, worst case scenario, uh, the              stock is worth  434 billion  Oh, sorry               I&m sorry  It was 13  It was 1300              billion is the uh market cap which would              put the      
  The huge news is out  AMD and Open AAI           have a massive new partnership, but a           lot of people are still very skeptical            They&re asking, &quot;Where will all the           money         other big story of the            morning, uh maybe of the week, we&ll            see  OpenAI making a deal with AMD on            data centers that&s going to run on    AMD            processors  The    stock is up big this            morning  Of course, this comes two weeks            after Nvidia made a massive deal uh with            OpenAI         Jim Kramer, of course, has been            following the AI story and Nvidia            specifically for so very long is at the            New York Stock Exchange uh head        of his            interview with AMD CEO Lisa Sue and Greg            Brockman, president of Open AI  Want to            uh get your thoughts on all of this,            Jim        not holding back  Let&s             break down some of the key points              First, Jim&s main idea is that this is             not a fight between AMD and Nvidia  He             says the skeptics who thought that only             one company could win were totally             wrong  This deal proves that the AI pie             is        a long-term vision  The real             story here is the incredible competition             to build the most powerful AI chips in             the world  How good is AMD compared to             Nvidia? That&s the real race we should             be watching  It&s time to focus on the             future, not the fears from the      
   the price getting              adjusted down today because of the              warrant distribution that already              happened  We&re just observing what&s              going on with the stock  And then when              the warrants are priced and begin              trading, it&ll be kind of interesting, I              think, to especially compare the                                    Eight bucks  Holy smokes               Yeah  This is why this is why you              diversify               Imagine if you were just sitting in one              meme stock and you&re watching all these              other ones run up 400                You got to spread your tentacles a              little bit, friends               A dollar a       of a              starting point on your journey to figure              out why why might they have such widely              different price targets? How are they              valuing the stock? and whose story seems              more accurate  Obviously, what we&re              going to find is they each have              different predictions for earnings,              forward earnings        you&re foregoing              the time premium, right?              That&s why typically bonds don&t get              converted early  But you also must              believe that the stock is              going to go up at some point               Otherwise, the              the time premium of that convertible              bond, the call option like time portion                     call              trigger price then all restrictions on              the company will no longer apply               So              they are limited by six months unless              the the stock is really trading up and              on high volume               Then              the the chains are unleashed  AMC may              dilute away              which also kind of makes       have a a contract renegotiation again?              Mother              three-year contract  Okay               Um, Craig says, &quot;What was the date again              to take note on the stock split vote?&quot;              The company announced              uh a shareholder vote  What is it, guys?              On December 9th,              I think it&s December 9th or around        word of              the day  Pon prowler               I feel like Yukon Cornelius today              looking at these warrant prices               Nothing               Nothing  Come on               Stock market NYC               You damn brokers               Get these warrants in everybody&s hands               They had to go change the fluid on the              mimograph machine, the synthetic       cents right               now  That&s almost as bad as Mullen                Not a lot               good there  Let&s look at the blue chip               list                AMD still doing good                Rough day  It&s a rough day, kids                In light of that, I&ll be happy that I               I&m gonna

Dazzic didn&t seem to care though               Wonder if it&s AMD and Nvidia are still              looking               Is    AMD still hot or is it cooled off              yet?              s a big part of it                      AMD is picking up a lot of steam still               So, up 5  today               Nvidia kind of doing its um kind of              sympathy rally with        that               Nvidia up 2   Yeah, that&s really what&s              flooding the NASDAQ  Nvidia and AMD               Everything else is not moving with such              aggression               Yeah               I wonder how Netflix is doing now               They&ve been getting cancelled                is going at              it? Actually, no  It&s it&s the              conservatives that are going at Netflix               Doesn&t look like Netflix&s stock really              took a little bit of hit on that               s a huge push on uh       Discord told me to &quot;              Like, that would have been the              appropriate answer if you would have              asked me  I didn&t know what a stock              did  Look, I just aped into it like a              m longing it cuz everyone&s              long in it               Freaking these        or things like that  They&re              really smart and very intuitive  People              like the trading in the zone book and              stuff and reminisces of stock operator               I don&t I don&t read any of that stuff               I don&t think it applies to date to              modern day trading        find options that belong to hedging               loops for market makers  An example is               if a dealer were to long or you were to               long stock and dealer were to short with               you uh short against you and then buy               calls we would look for that               relationship  The calls will        is               went from negative positive 20 to               negative6 resilience  The white line is               a gap flux predictor  It&s an aggregate               of stock gap fills and it looks at the               S&amp;P relative to its implied value based               on the gap fill calculations of the               components inside       
   see here              We&ve got             while AI draw drew the most attention              The real pressure may be on a smaller             group of stock who have soared since             liberation day  The top 10 best             performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in percentage             terms have surged an average of         is fully built out and uh             generating revenue nearly instantly              Some of this is due to the trend line,             right? Like the stock has been trending             up  So, some of that activity is is just             like all right momentum  But that&s             worth paying attention       Don&t Don&t write it  Don&t Don&t say              it               Uh, okay  So, Oracle became the best              performing mega cap stock of 2025 after              its executive said last month that the              once sleepy database firm will generate              an astonishing 381 billion in revenue              from        declining              substantially               And then if you go to where they&re              making money, the financing side, look              right here               They&re issuing stock of a billion              dollars               You know what? What period of time was              this? In three months, dude  In three              months, they issued       are we paying dividends and you guys              are financing? So,  800 million in              financing,              800 mil in financing, and 1 1 bill in              stock issuance to pay 1 4 billion              dividends and raise capital               All right, this isn&t great               Okay,              so              the Q&s are pissed        what&s              to come  You know, there&s another              oracle known as the Oracle of Omaha, who              also tells us that the stock market is              the most overvalued by 217  on the              Buffet indicator that it has ever been              in the history of market valuations          with that money?              We&re taking on  800 million more              financing in just 3 months  We&re              issuing  1 1 billion of stock  So,              they&re diluting their investors               Uh, and they&re using some of it to pay              dividends and the rest to finance        going to              begin their data center deployments with              the money that OpenAI              has to spend on AMD chips               And then of course    AMD will get revenues              which will lead    AMD stock to go up which              open door or sorry open AAI owns shares              of warrants of              and        means              Nvidia doesn&t get the revenue               Which means Nvidia,              oh crap, can&t invest anymore               Which means that OpenAI stock or that                 AMD stock isn&t going to go up  Which              means Open AI doesn&t have more money,              which means no more more Nvidia               Oh      
                 discussion in the chat box for today um              I think that we can get a good grasp as              to what&s happening with both the stock              and the warrants               All right               So first let&s just technically analyze              these charts               Okay               Alrighty               So            indicator signals, regarding support and              resistance, regarding the point of              control, regarding all of the people              that buy, hold, sell, and trade this              stock  All of that is very real               People at hedge funds, banks,              institutions pay people like me hundreds              of thousands of dollars a year for the       it has traded higher as a shittier              business many times before               Not only that, but some of the largest              holders of GameStop have bought the              stock              more expensive than even where the share              price currently is               It is not a reflection on people&s              intelligence or stupidity               It is a       in the              business as it fundamentally continues              to improve and become extremely              efficient              that will once again drive the demand              for the stock, the share price and              ultimately shareholder value               If the share price were to go lower, I              want you to understand that I hold              shares        so              far  Boy, did it this take a really long              time  But there you go  We got some              movement on Heli  Finally  Finally               AMD 4  otherwise the market is very very              very slow right now               Let&s check in on              Okay, ANF is still chilling  So, it&s                    to              ultimately go higher because you              wouldn&t price the warrants at a price              that makes no logical sense unless you              thought that the stock was going to be              above said illogical price              and fundamentally the company is worth              32 bucks a share               s brand new stock               I can see that  And it looks like it              retraced to a golden pocket  I can see              that back above the daily 50, back above        close towards center  But for right now,               we&re down 2  on the day  And it&s not a               surprise because literally every stock               in the    stock market is getting s a couple of               ones that are doing okay, right?

   ? And uh today, uh AMD is            not doing much, but it seems to have            settled  I mean, it&s got more volume            than normal, don&t get me wrong, but it            seems to have settled  We&ve decided      much, but it seems to have            settled  I mean, it&s got more volume            than normal, don&t get me wrong, but it            seems to have settled  We&ve decided now            that uh AMD is a  200    stock again  So,            all right       , here here we sit  So, well            done AMD if it can hold this level  Now,            we&ll see  Last time it was here, it                   have to get              out  Not saying, just keep in mind you              might see a little pressure with the spy              selling down here, but if this stock is              strong, it&s it can push through that,              right? Um,              but uh might see a little pressure as              other tickers are getting        I feel like it&s everything is besides              everything is just black  Like, well, I              don&t see anything  Uh, AMD short    AMD              AMD breakdown  I don&t know, man     AMD I              I think it&s a short, but the hopes of              shorts are leaving and getting lesser              and lesser because we               weeklies               So again, it partly depends on what your              trade book, you know, what kind of              strategies you&re using               Exactly               Texas stock exchange  I I I guess it&s              uh you know it it could draw some it              could draw some volume away from this              market but       had this I I got to ask him              a little bit more about that again  We              actually talked a bit about neuro              divergence              in stock trading which I thought was              cool               Yeah  No, that was one of the big things              that definitely resonated with you and              that you       you talk              about things like behavioral slippage              and even you and I kind of side talked              about neurode divergence in the uh in              stock trading and it was a really like              really engaging conversation probably my              most engaging conversation of the uh of              the weekend I think  So        things I was a musician               actually going through school so um so               it&s it kind of fit in line with that               actually find stock trading and reading               sheet music to actually be very similar                Um, so               we&ve had that with a lot of people from                       Oh, how fun  The profit of profit  I               love that guy                But yeah, anytime we could we could               definitely talk neurode divergence and               stock trading on there for sure  That&d               be a fun one                Get a little neurosicy  But yeah,               anytime you want to hang out, I&d
