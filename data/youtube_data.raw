   que uma parte da             sociedade vai precisar de apoio para             garantir determinados standards de vida             e pá, então, então na realidade quando             olhamos para uma Microsoft vemos devemos             mensurar como em footstamps             ou em ouro ou em BTC ou noutra moeda,             não é? é que neste momento nós olhamos             para         tão grande que tu já não             vais conseguir trocar sem o desconto              Portanto, o que isto significa é quando             nós olhamos para uma ação da Microsoft,             será que devemos medi-la em dólares, que             neste momento são transacionados             diretamente entre um para um, entre food             stamp e dólar,             ou será      Guerra da              Lurson  Eh, e portanto o que me parece é              que isto são basicamente equity swaps,              não é? Que o gajo diz: &quot;O nosso stock tá              tão overpriced, eu não posso emitir              ações por causa do que isso significa               Vamos só comprar empresas que estão              menos overpriced, não é?      ou              mesmo equity swap ou é              não, eles vão emitir, não, não estão,              eles estão a investir com cash, mas eles              vão ter que emitir stock para conseguir              fazer as aquisições  Portanto, na              prática, eles já não têm cash suficiente              para fazer todas as aquisições que estão              estão       anunciar  E, portanto, a              ideia é que tu vais emitir stock para              financiar as aquisições  E, portanto, o              que tu estás na prática a fazer é estás              a dar uma justificação para a emissão de                     stock, não é? Porque tu precisas de uma              justificação, senão, qual é? Se tu vais              só emitir    stock, tu, o mercado              interpreta isso como              caixa,              estamos              overvalid, não é? Eh, a gestão acha que                    ?              E, portanto, acaba por ser bom para os              acionistas da Rain Metal, não é? não              significa que o stock não esteja              overvalued, mas mas é melhor tu trocares              o teu    stock por por empresas estão              menos               Mas mas por acaso o caso da da R              curioso, tu tu é que chamaste       Intellectual              Property, andou aqui a fazer manobras              para se salvar  Eh, se olharmos para a              aquisição da da Activision como              estratégica por parte da Microsoft, eu              acho que ela teria sempre algum apelo               Aliás, esta este spinoff, entre aspas,              esta empresa que eles criaram, que detém              o IP, é,

Que muchas veces uno dice, &quot;No,              hizo no hicieron &quot; La primera emisión la              hicieron claramente con la intención de              que entre al stock connect para que haya              más liquidez, para que para que cuando              subiera el market cap sea más alto  O              sea, pero fíjate que en su        sea,              al fin y al cabo es una empresa minera              que tiene sus problemas y no no termina              pasando nada  Bueno, desde que entró al              Stock Connect, ya hará dos o tres años,              el inversor chino también empezó a hacer              ese ese acostumbramiento al riesgo de              decir primero que que he       de              beneficios, no no es un proceso largo,              &gt;&gt; es una burrada  Fernando Cabalero dice,              &quot;¿Tenés alguna estimación de cuándo              entrará Consul en el Stock Connect?&quot; Yo,              por lo que entendí lo que leí,              &gt;&gt; sí, por lo que entendí lo que leí, tiene              que pasar un año donde el promedio       sea,              los indexados son comprar esto              más al bueno de Mar Zuckerberg que dice              que no le importa quemar 200,000              millones              más Google más Microsoft Pesla también              tiene mucho peso ahí              &gt;&gt; cuando es              &gt;&gt; Apple que está que está en fin y está              como está cuando toda esta estructura              empieza       próximo trimestre viene              con un más 20  de beneficios, Envía con              un más 20  de beneficios, eh Tesla              empieza a vender Optimus como churros y              Microsoft sube un 15 , esto va se              mantiene, o sea, estamos bien               &gt;&gt; Sí, ¿no? Ahí lo que pasaría es que sube              el free casash flow, por      
    at            least previous all-time highs, man, let            alone new highs  Big tech stocks are            setting new record thanks to the AI            meta  Microsoft hit an all-time high in            July, returning about 35  since January             That&s almost identical to Bitcoin&s            returns  Google&s up around 36       relatively            strong compared to the lows of the year             And it&s not just price action for            stocks  Some tech stocks pay real            dividends  Microsoft, for example, got a            pretty pathetic one at 0 67 , which            means for every  100 investor, you just             get 67  per 67 cents        t get me wrong, but             at least we&re seeing a move towards             more of that in crypto  Now, I&ve never             seen a a stock IPO, of course, doesn&t             have tons insiders, and there             should be insiders  You know, these             ideas need early funding and like             that        have its purposes              Anyway, comparing stocks to crypto is             hardly fair, but let&s just give it a             shot  Take the number five stock in the             SPF 100, which is Amazon versus Salana,             which is also number five minus stable             coins  If you bought in 2024 and sold        to lay it out here for you  Take the             barrier to entry  For example, in the             US, the pattern uh day trading rule             forces stock traders to keep at least              25,000 in equity before they can day             trade  In crypto, you can start as a             little 10 bucks          In             fact, at most of my profits that I&m             making in the cryptocurrency markets,             I&m taking out and putting into the             stock market  Doesn&t mean I&m leaving             crypto forever or anything like that              just that when the profits happen there,             take it and put        Other places are better             for potentially storing except for             Bitcoin  That&s a different story  But             just imagine if you picked up Micro             Strategy stock back in 2023  Sure, it&s             30  off its all-time highs, but you&d             still be up over 2,500  today  Coinbase                    way             they treat stocks  Because we&ll get             more and more professional             happening in crypto, too  Think about             it  Why do you buy a stock? Not just for             the returns, but because you believe in             the company&s products and services  I             mean, returns, too  But you&re not       GPU networks and on and on             and on  And yeah, stocks been having a             great run  multiple new all-time highs             this year for the stock market  But             crypto is no longer just a speculative             game  It&s laying down the financial             rails, the infrastructure, and even the             AI      
    I            lost so much opportunity to actually 5            10 or even 15x my net worth because I            could have been investing in companies             like Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Google              These are all companies that I invest in             today, but if I were investing in them             20 years ago, I would be so        any             type of rental properties or anything             like that  Myth number four is investing             in the stock market is only for rich             people  Whenever I was younger, I was             always taught stay away from the    stock             market  It&s like the casino  You put             money in, you never get anything out              And        for years, I shied away from even             learning about the stock market because             I just thought it was a scam  Only             certain people made money and everybody             else lost money  But once I started to             study        you a quick example             of two different types of people that             invest in the stock market, make bad             choices, which ultimately shapes their             view on how they view the    stock market              So, person number one goes into the                stock market, they invest in Apple, for             example, Apple is trading at  100 a             share         But they             didn&t  Person number two gets hyped up             about a meme stock, GameStop, for             example  They go in, they spend  120 on             GameStop    stock  And anyone that knows             anything about the    stock market knows             that GameStop is a meme    stock, and it             probably should be trading at  10 a             share, if that         But this person jumped             on the hype train, got in at 120, and             had the hopes of making a lot of money             really quick  That stock goes back down             to  10, they lose most of their money,             they get out of the market, they never             invest again  So those types of        BGT  If you want to invest in             the S&amp;P 500, you can invest in             Vanguard&s VO or in SPY  So investing in             the stock market only being for rich             people was a myth that I fell for back             in the day  Myth number five, if I made             a little      
   yes              &gt;&gt; Um, Intel and Nvidia jointly develop AI             infrastructure and personal computing             products  Five 5 billion 5 billion             investment uh in Intel common stock  Uh             and uh apparently Nvidia GPUs will be on             some of your processors  Uh you guys can             read the news, but what can we say        more by us than most              people, right? Because of XESS and um              upscaling and all sorts of things that              we actually do for  But now Microsoft              has come out with a with part of a              co-pilot using their thing to beat a              tough boss on PC  Uh, and it won         I can never find an LE               Matt, you were able to just order it,              weren&t you?              &gt;&gt; It is very in stock right now  I&m              actually very in    stock into Discord               &gt;&gt; It&s on new and it&s at MSRP  I know              some people have complained about that              like in the        recent past               &gt;&gt; Um but yeah, 249 it&s a great card               &gt;&gt; And and the term that he said was not              just in stock, he said very        in stock               &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&ve been seeing it like over the              last week or so, which is great  I love              &gt;&gt; So if you are looking        to the              &gt;&gt; Oh my god               Okay  Now, what we&re going to do is              we&re going to lay this down               Get these               &gt;&gt; Come on  Stock market  Here we go               &gt;&gt; Yes               &gt;&gt; This is not financial advice               &gt;&gt; What? Oh my god               We&re down               &gt;&gt; Here we go               &gt;&gt; Going down     
   institutional conviction that paints a            far more compelling picture than a            single day&s trading activity would            suggest  The expectation for a volatile            speculative AI stock is one of erratic            news-driven spikes and plummets  The            reality of Resolve AI, however, is a            meticulously orchestrated expansion  A            story of a company        horizon  It&s a classic case             of the market&s short-term memory             failing to account for long-term             strategic execution              Delving into the recent stock movement,             the daily swings, while             attentiongrabbing, are but a small piece             of a much larger puzzle  Trading volumes             have been consistently robust,          healthy level of             institutional interest  This isn&t the             sporadic, low volume trading             characteristic of a purely speculative             stock  We&re seeing significant blocks             of shares changing hands, a clear sign             that major players are accumulating             positions  This institutional activity             is the       a growth stock  The             silent endorsement from the likes of             Citadel, Black Rockck, and Vanguard, all             of whom have recently taken positions              These are not firms known        and their             customers, fostering loyalty and             creating a truly differentiated brand             experience  And the company&s strategic             partnerships with giants like Microsoft             and Google provide a powerful             distribution channel allowing Resolve to             tap into a vast and growing ecosystem of             potential clients  This is not a company      conclusion, the             narrative surrounding Resolve AI is a             classic example of expectation versus             reality  The expectation is that of a             volatile, high-risk AI stock, a             speculative play in a crowded and often             overhyped market  The reality, however,             is a company with a proven scalable             business model, a growing roster       of             institutional investors and a clear path             to long-term sustainable growth  The             recent intraday stock price movement,             while a point of interest, is ultimately             a distraction from the much more             compelling story of a company on the             cusp of greatness      
   10               actualizaciones diarias personalizadas               donde podrán conocer ustedes ese día               resumido  Lo hará por la inteligencia               artificial  Mirando a Microsoft,               importante durante la jornada de hoy,               también con caídas como meta, aunque eso               sí, ellos no caen tanto, un 0,54                llegando a esos 507                      puntos  Microsoft que conocíamos que               bloqueó el acceso de la unidad de 8,200               del ejército israelí a sus servicios de               la nube de inteligencia artificial  Esta       que violabas sus               términos de uso  Según ha informado el               medio de Guardian, dice que la unidad               procesaba hasta 1 millón de llamadas por               hora  Microsoft que inmediatamente               desactivó varios servicios, presionado               también por los empleados y por los               inversores  Ahora sí, dejando de lado al               mercado,      economic               numbers were off the chart, sir,               unfortunately, right? Because this is               the only country in the world where you               announce great numbers in the stock               market goes down because when you               announce great numbers, they immediately               want to take that success away by               raising the interest rate  Why can&t       focus               on this like Allan Greensband did in the               90s  You can have strong growth and low               inflation and I think we can get the               stock market up  Wall Street, Main               Street both doing well  And low, we want               low interest rates  There&s no reason               that every time we announce       numbers were off the               chart, sir, unfortunately, right?               Because this is the only country in the               world where you announce great numbers               and the stock market goes down because               when you announce great numbers, they               immediately want to take that success               away by raising the interest rate  Why               can&t       focus               on this like Allan Greensband did in the               90s  You can have strong growth and low               inflation and I think we can get the               stock market up  Wall Street, Main               Street both doing well  And low, we want               low interest rates  There&s no reason               that every time we announce      
   modified version of             uh Windows 11  And I would recommend you             only stick with an authorized version of             Windows 11 derived directly from             Microsoft for free legally  And then             just to that add your specific drivers              So, it&s nice to verify that you have             drivers available       is a              brilliant solution for people that have              Windows 10 computers that are about to              age out due to a lack of support from              Microsoft               We do have a video showing you how you              can get 12 more months, but you&re just              prolonging the inevitable               A        That              way, it just boots right to the desktop               Once the customer has it, they can              customize it and they can log into              Microsoft account, whatever they choose               I like to leave location settings on               That&s going to keep my date and time              always up to date       I was  So, I click on that and              under this right here              under more settings, show search              highlights  I turn that off  Now,              Microsoft updates have changed the              location of this, but you can still find              it  And when you do, your screen might              look a little different  Use       you what a how victimized I&ve been              that somebody stole my wallet that I              left at the countertop at the coffee              shop               So Microsoft has learned this is              consumer behaviors and unfortunately it              represents the majority of consumer              behaviors  Not everyone, but the vast              majority          &t care until it happens to              them  So, Microsoft says, &quot;Well, we              don&t care if you like this or not              because we&re not going to listen to you              say that we         good for  So, if you think I&ll wait              till next week to buy it, I don&t know              how many are in stock and I don&t know              if the coupon will still be valid  It              might be  I&m not trying to put any              pressure        reason              sells out or a coupon code ends              unexpectedly              or              there&s a low inventory  We don&t know              how many are in stock  So, could be              thousands, could be a few  I don&t know               But you if you buy it from Amazon with              that 30        it is today or less  I              don&t know  I don&t know anybody who              knows  If I did, I&d be in the stock              market and I&d probably be really super              wealthy  So, I&ll let you know when that              happens               So, anybody tells you that

               picture  So about 87  of the H1 visas             go to American tech companies  The             largest of them being Amazon, right?             Starts with Amazon, Google, Microsoft,             Netflix, Apple, you name it  All of             these American companies, they grab 87              of the H1 visas  Then the other 13  goes             to large        and the same American             economy  So             at the end of the day uh 87  of the H1s             are taken by American corporations like             Google, Microsoft etc  And why are they             going for H1 visas? Right? That&s the             very first question one must ask              Uh technology changes very fast          roughly a             little bit over 2/3 of the entire work             entire H1 kota uh is recruited from             India uh that&s companies like Microsoft             and others they hire from India people             who have already been trained and who             have put in a couple of years 3 four                   be true but for             most of the cases it is not because when             87  of the H1s go to American             corporations like Google and Microsoft             obviously they do not have any policy of             discriminating based on your visa status             or based on your ethnicity or any of             those         I had a             different theory and that is that there             is one parameter that a lot of people             look at before investing in a stock             which is the revenue per employee             for the revenue part they they take all             the income that a company gets but when             it        and a             brick and mortar company like Proctrum             Gamble is at 776,000 per employee              So what happens it induces a skew in the             stock market  Now some of you may say oh             this is not the only factor they are             looking at before they decide to invest             in the        stock  Then those of you who say             that explain this to me  Do you know             that the entire frothy Dow Jones             Industrial Average and        the pinnacle of their professions              because there is nothing beyond running              a a close to trillion dollar company              like Alphabet or uh or or uh Microsoft               But what made you who you are?              It&s the values you learned growing up               Why can&t you just say okay I&        uh so              even if they&re hired in uh Chennai or              Noida or Pune or any other place  Uh so              these uh companies when Microsoft goes              to Indian campuses they hire the best               When Google goes to Indian campuses they              hire the best  So those are the people                   
          hopes for a revived universe were raised             and then dashed  And whilst space games             certainly lived on, this title             unfortunately was never to be              Microsoft&s 2003 PC title Freelancer             holds a special place in space sim             history as an open world game that let             players fly between planets, take                    quietly in development in the mid 2000s,             but it too ended up among the stars that             never aligned  In 2006, Digital Anvil,             then owned by Microsoft, began working             on a sequel cenamed Project Lonear for             Xbox 360  Unlike its PCON predecessor,             Freelancer 2 was being designed             specifically for console play,       a shift in strategy to bring             space sims to the living room              Unfortunately, a freelancer 2 never made             it far  Microsoft shut down Digital             Anvil in early 2006 as part of a studio             consolidation, cancing all projects in             development, including Freelancer 2              Unfortunately, in      , at the             time, Microsoft&s decision to can the             project likely came down to business             priorities  Freelancer had been             moderately successful on PC, but not a             blockbuster, and Digital      quietly evaporated  In             later years, Freelancer devotees kept             the flame alive via mods, the Discovery             mod, and others had extended the game             far beyond its stock content  And of             course, Chris Roberts himself went on to             launch the Star Citizen project, which             in many ways is a spiritual successor,             attempting to        a tinker with smaller             prototypes and within a year or two it             would also be a moving on from Mojang             entirely after its acquisition by              Microsoft  The cancellation of tent to              the sea then was a bit of a letdown to              those who had followed it  But many              understood the toll      
   digital downloads and            online marketplaces were taking over             But then something happened  A movement            was born and GME became more than just a            stock  It became a symbol of retail            power, a modern David versus Goliath            battle, and perhaps one of the most            disruptive financial stories of             Wall Street Bets  They noticed something            interesting  GameStop was heavily            shorted by hedge funds, meaning big            institutions were betting against the            stock in huge volumes  In fact, the            short interest at one point was over            100  of the available shares, which            theoretically shouldn&t even be       rare             moment of victory  But after the initial             squeeze, the story didn&t end  GameStop             remained in the spotlight  It became a             battleground stock with price swings,             volatility, and intense scrutiny  And             for many, it was never just about the             money  It was about exposing flaws in        potentially even blockchain technology              Under this new leadership, GameStop has             revamped its executive team, brought in             talent from companies like Amazon and             Microsoft, and started investing in tech             infrastructure  They&ve launched a             refreshed e-commerce platform  They&ve             explored web 3 gaming and NFTts  They&ve                    did recently             was eliminate all of its long-term debt              That&s huge  The company raised capital             by issuing shares during the meme stock             surge, and instead of blowing it, they             used it to clean up the balance sheet              That means they&re now operating             debt       payments or refinancing             maturing debt  It also gives them time,             something most struggling retailers             don&t have  Now, let&s shift to the             stock itself  GME remains one of the             most volatile and widely watched stocks             in the market  The daily volume, the             number of people tracking it,       massive short             squeeze  They track short interest data              They analyze options flow and they call             out suspicious trading activity  In             their view, the stock is still heavily             manipulated and the original thesis             hasn&t changed  And to be fair, short             interest in GME still remains unusually             high         continued             speculation that another move, a second             squeeze, could be possible under the             right conditions  On top of that, GME is             a stock with limited float, meaning a             relatively small number of shares are             available for trading  Combine that with             a highly motivated retail base and

Micron put up a tremendous beat and              raise uh after the close two days ago               Stock was up uh 13 bucks after hour,              wound up closing down yesterday and is              down is indicated down another two 3               this morning  So you        basically have a              darling stock uh in in the right place              in the right markets uh a play on              inference growth and AI buildout and              usage and you know blew        the doors off              the numbers beat by 30  and the stock              the    stock&s down right it&s an you know              it&s an expectations versus reality              situation the    stock had been a              tremendous performer and now it&s              correcting and it&s 10  off the        the doorstep of a 3 to 5  correction               I don&t think it&ll be much more than              that  In part because the New York Stock              Exchange advanced decline line has              continued to make new highs               Historically, prior to intermediate              pullbacks, in other words, the 7 to 10                            is likely  Um, but not much more than              that just based on market breath  And              again, for to get, you know, 30               declines in the stock market, you need              the either a big-time event or you need              the economy going into a recession  And              we don&t really have signs      
   &s             real strength is deeper than that  Let             me show you why  Segment one  What is             the three fund portfolio? Imagine owning             the entire US stock market, every major             international market, a huge basket of             highquality bonds, all with just three             funds  No guesswork, no jumping in and             out, no constantly       right  Jack Bogle, the founder of             Vanguard, popularized this and it stood             the test of time  The three funds are             the US total stock market fund, the             international    stock market fund, and the             total bond market fund  Sounds too             simple? Hang on because what&s inside             each of these and how they        work together             is where things get interesting  Segment             two, the three core components  One, US             total stock market fund  Own thousands             of companies, Apple,    Microsoft, Nvidia,             Meta, plus tons you&ve never heard of,             all powering the economy  Here are the             examples of funds that you        could use for             this  VTI from Vanguard and SCHV from             Schwab  Fees so low around 0 3  or three             basis point you&d hardly notice them              Two, the International Stock      
    people  You know, it&s              not that hard to see  Go look at some of              the people that run the biggest tech              companies  You know, Microsoft, Google,              those are not Joe Smith, okay? You know,              these are these are um every single name              is somebody that came here, you know,              and        say they are              or you say they are for innovation              d              I&m going to ask and answer my own              question here               Why is the stock market doing so well?              And you&re going to tell me it&s because              the dollar&s in decline  You&re you&re              saying basically                      Enrollment is down               Well, I mean this is just this is              something brand new  It&s not hasn&t              I know but why is the stock market doing              so well if the Trump policies are so              bad?              Sure  And that&s totally fair  And the              answer is I think I think        you just you              just mentioned it is is well the US              dollar&s gotten destroyed  So basically              the stock market, you know, it&s up what              2 or 3  on the year if you subtract the              dollar decline off the        stock market              rally  It&s a tiny little move  And and              I think that&s a very fair way to look              at it  And also, you         you              you have all these criticisms of these              Trump policies and this and this and              this               Why is the stock market where it is? And              my answer is always imagine where the                 stock market would be if it wasn&t for              all these policies               That is the correct answer  But the              other        I don&t ever bring              that up because it&s not that that&s not              that important to me  And and I also              think the stock market the concentration              of you know the top seven stocks which              have made 30 up you know 30  of the              indexes now and the moves                     I&m not saying that that&s not okay  I&m              just saying that, you know, you can put              a lot of context around the stock market              move              and I get and I&m just going to circle              back to my point, which is for all the              horrible horrible things and        really              bismerched himself to last four or five              years in this not just the challenge is              when he came back the stock traded um              just over a hundred and now the    stock&s              113  and it&s been years  So, you know,              the the IGER movement in Disney has not,              you know      
   que a mí todo eso me             parece muy bien, ¿no? Pero esas             premoniciones de que los Estados Unidos             iban a desaparecer, de que el stock             market iba a implosionar, pues la verdad             no se ha dado, ¿no? De hecho, yo no te             digo a ti que, y        total sean unos unos 75 puntos básicos,             ¿no?             Entonces, aquí es donde entráis vosotros             porque y el miedo a que el el todo el             stock market e pueda sufrir un shock,             porque verás tú, te quería presentar             esto también antes, ¿no? Estos dos             gráficos se están hablando mucho los        un 212               Él salió explicando lo que es el market             cap, tu producto interior bruto, ¿no? Y             realmente existe una sobreevaluación de             los stock market, que es lo que está             trayendo el miedo a que esto pueda caer,             ¿no? Pero a la es que es son como dos             sentimientos        pasando en             los Estados Unidos y y a esto pregunta,             ¿va a llegar esa por otro lado va a             llegar esa avalancha de cash al stock             market para continuar con este tema?             Bueno, pues             &gt;&gt; eso, ahí es donde yo quería preguntarte,             María, porque se dice que hay un        tú muy bien dices, de             sacar mi dinero, de estar aparcado en un             33 con5, que la inflación me está             comiendo y llevarlo al al stock market              Y aquí está la pregunta  Entonces,             depende de quien tú lo digas, ¿no?             Porque             hay mucha gente que dice, &quot;Bueno, a        supermercado  No, hay quien dice,             &quot;No, no lo voy a sacar porque las             acciones es que están carísimas y             entonces es que comprar Microsoft o             comprar cualquier de estos es que no me             cunde  Entonces no me cunde, ¿no? Y y             luego aparte está todo este miedo de        ellos compran compran acciones              &gt;&gt; exactamente de algún de todas las              posibilidades, ¿no? E por ejemplo, mira              el número de familias que tienen stock,              casi el 60  y es muy interesante ver              quién tiene los    stock  Mira como la              generación X y los Millenials están              empezando a meterse en el mundo del                     stock market  Sí, es cierto que los baby              boomers, bueno, los pobres pues ahí              están amarrados, ¿no? Eh, otras e otras              generaciones anteriores        este señor eh piensa que              ups, piensa que podamos estar a las              puertas de esto con tanta presión social              que hay en este mundo del stock market,              ¿hasta cuándo ese crash eh que se              espere, que mucha gente habla? Hm  va va              a ocurrir, ¿no? Porque porque se      
   which is flat, maybe we get             back there  So, if we&re back at 44 in             the 10-year, where do you think the             stock market is? Especially if the data             is come like like like you know, if the             data is okay here, you know, we see that        , all that sort of stuff &quot; Heads              down building this thing  What the              investor base was doing, what investors              in general were doing with the stock,              that&s another story  And you know, we              make this case all the time  It&s like,              okay, it&s one thing if       bring down the revenue              expectations of US tech companies  So              there there are a couple things that a              lot of this hype especially in stock              prices has depended on remaining true               If those things do not remain true, then              I think you go over that peak and and                     you go through this period of like, oh              my gosh, it it&s over or you know, the              the stock valuations are over               &gt;&gt; Well, I I think it&s more market related              than actually as it relates to, you              know, and and        over again that shows the proportion              of returns attributable to earnings              growth and then the proportion              attributable to multiple expansion  This              is a stock that would fall into that              multiple expansion piece, at least that              big spike up and some of what we&re              seeing now, giving back        one              of the things that that that&s a great              example of just an you know irrational              sort of move that the the stock was              trading I think at like three times the              value of its Bitcoin that it holds  And              it&s just interesting to me       It&s just broken that uptrend that&s              been in place since uh late 2023  That&s              just a technical thing  We know the              stock is always well expensive to the              retail group to the market that sort of              thing  What do you think a 13  um you              know                     really well through that inflationary              phase because they were lowerc cost              providers to consumers and it was              helpful and I think that their stock              prices responded and and rightfully so              they were rewarded for that and and if              there was good inventory management even              better right they       They invested in              Cororeweave, which is a NeoCloud, which              is a company um that basically um              creates these data centers that a              company like Microsoft will use when              they need excess capacity  They sign              long-term deals  So, Nvidia is an              investor there  Nvidia is now investor              um      
   you&re supervised learning  You              already know that um the outcome for              tomorrow for you know going back a week               You&re looking at stock  You can already              have like the graph of what the next day              looks like  So you have an answer for              it               And                      Um where anything that you predict is              going to return more than a certain              amount of money  Um the error for that              stock that you&ve had in the past, you              put those in buckets and suddenly you              start putting the creating these              buckets  You realize       off this today                But at least you can give an eye you can               give a step forward in how to start               processing something like stock prices                a very valid use for machine learning in               today&s markets  Use case implementation               of LSTM                Let&s dive in         at the open               price  We&re not looking at how many               volumes were traded  Like I was pointing               out earlier when we talk about stock,               just right off the bat, there&s six               columns  There&s open, high, low, close,               volume  Then there&s whether uh        low,               adjusted close  They have a special               formula to predict exactly what it would               really be worth based on the value of               the stock  And then from there, there&s               all kinds of other stuff you can put in               here  So, we&re only looking at one        did this for this particular               example  Um but I do this a lot when I&m               working with series and and specifically               in stock data  I wanted to iterate               through the first set of 30 data before               it does anything  Um I would have to               look deeper       do? Well,               let&s list out the things neural               networks can do for you  Translate text                Boy, we got Google Translate and               Microsoft has their own translate  They               have some really cool  They actually               have an earpiece  It&s supposed to start               translating as you talk          need to               give it a prompt to find out real Google               images from uh Google search results and               add them instead of the stock               thumbnails  Now let&s quickly go through               Galaxy or you know any Android phone  So               it&s just it works just pretty         instructions making it easy to follow               and your best part is to start small               build apps that solve specific problems               like booking appointments managing stock               or helping with sales and guess what you               can even create apps that people pay               monthly for  Now let&s talk about money
