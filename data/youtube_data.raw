   que uma parte da             sociedade vai precisar de apoio para             garantir determinados standards de vida             e pá, então, então na realidade quando             olhamos para uma Microsoft vemos devemos             mensurar como em footstamps             ou em ouro ou em BTC ou noutra moeda,             não é? é que neste momento nós olhamos             para         tão grande que tu já não             vais conseguir trocar sem o desconto              Portanto, o que isto significa é quando             nós olhamos para uma ação da Microsoft,             será que devemos medi-la em dólares, que             neste momento são transacionados             diretamente entre um para um, entre food             stamp e dólar,             ou será      Guerra da              Lurson  Eh, e portanto o que me parece é              que isto são basicamente equity swaps,              não é? Que o gajo diz: &quot;O nosso stock tá              tão overpriced, eu não posso emitir              ações por causa do que isso significa               Vamos só comprar empresas que estão              menos overpriced, não é?      ou              mesmo equity swap ou é              não, eles vão emitir, não, não estão,              eles estão a investir com cash, mas eles              vão ter que emitir stock para conseguir              fazer as aquisições  Portanto, na              prática, eles já não têm cash suficiente              para fazer todas as aquisições que estão              estão       anunciar  E, portanto, a              ideia é que tu vais emitir stock para              financiar as aquisições  E, portanto, o              que tu estás na prática a fazer é estás              a dar uma justificação para a emissão de                     stock, não é? Porque tu precisas de uma              justificação, senão, qual é? Se tu vais              só emitir    stock, tu, o mercado              interpreta isso como              caixa,              estamos              overvalid, não é? Eh, a gestão acha que                    ?              E, portanto, acaba por ser bom para os              acionistas da Rain Metal, não é? não              significa que o stock não esteja              overvalued, mas mas é melhor tu trocares              o teu    stock por por empresas estão              menos               Mas mas por acaso o caso da da R              curioso, tu tu é que chamaste       Intellectual              Property, andou aqui a fazer manobras              para se salvar  Eh, se olharmos para a              aquisição da da Activision como              estratégica por parte da Microsoft, eu              acho que ela teria sempre algum apelo               Aliás, esta este spinoff, entre aspas,              esta empresa que eles criaram, que detém              o IP, é,

               picture  So about 87  of the H1 visas             go to American tech companies  The             largest of them being Amazon, right?             Starts with Amazon, Google, Microsoft,             Netflix, Apple, you name it  All of             these American companies, they grab 87              of the H1 visas  Then the other 13  goes             to large        and the same American             economy  So             at the end of the day uh 87  of the H1s             are taken by American corporations like             Google, Microsoft etc  And why are they             going for H1 visas? Right? That&s the             very first question one must ask              Uh technology changes very fast          roughly a             little bit over 2/3 of the entire work             entire H1 kota uh is recruited from             India uh that&s companies like Microsoft             and others they hire from India people             who have already been trained and who             have put in a couple of years 3 four                   be true but for             most of the cases it is not because when             87  of the H1s go to American             corporations like Google and Microsoft             obviously they do not have any policy of             discriminating based on your visa status             or based on your ethnicity or any of             those         I had a             different theory and that is that there             is one parameter that a lot of people             look at before investing in a stock             which is the revenue per employee             for the revenue part they they take all             the income that a company gets but when             it        and a             brick and mortar company like Proctrum             Gamble is at 776,000 per employee              So what happens it induces a skew in the             stock market  Now some of you may say oh             this is not the only factor they are             looking at before they decide to invest             in the        stock  Then those of you who say             that explain this to me  Do you know             that the entire frothy Dow Jones             Industrial Average and        the pinnacle of their professions              because there is nothing beyond running              a a close to trillion dollar company              like Alphabet or uh or or uh Microsoft               But what made you who you are?              It&s the values you learned growing up               Why can&t you just say okay I&        uh so              even if they&re hired in uh Chennai or              Noida or Pune or any other place  Uh so              these uh companies when Microsoft goes              to Indian campuses they hire the best               When Google goes to Indian campuses they              hire the best  So those are the people                   
    at it like this             is just a pseudo bailout  They&re             they&re comparing Intel this Intel move              They&re comparing it to Apple and             Microsoft in 1998 where remember Apple             was failing at one point  You know, it&s             hard for some of you to believe that,             but in the        early days of tech, Apple was             doing really bad and then Microsoft took             a stake  Uh it was kind of symbolic just             to to kind of give him a lifeline and             help out  All right, man  You       absolutely nothing  So             be mindful of that              Mhm  Core weave             ">Microsoft back open             AAI by up to 6 5 billion              That was in the morning  That was right             before the bell  So, I don&t know       leading              into Santa rally front run  So I&d pay              attention  You might miss it  You might              miss it               It&s emotional               ">Microsoft on the low  Let&s see  Apple&s              actually holding up pretty good  And              then Amazon got merckked yesterday               They&re still down               Coreweave chill        and the chips go, it&ll get              you right back up here  But now the              bonds have to pay for that one               ">Microsoft blocks Israeli use of some              surveillance tech              or              t              look at last      &s still pockets that are able to              move up even when it&s down  And then by              next Tuesday, I think it&ll free up              Microsoft               Uh, that&s old  I think Guardian  Yeah,              that&s old               m done  I sold all              the Not all of                     the last couple of years because I feel              like everything just looks like in the              AI world or Olo just reminds me of a              China stock  Very different but similar              movement              s why I put it up there again               Dude        Kimuk  For the entire               interview, go to Bloomberg terminal or               to bloomberg com                All right, we&re going to stick with               autos here for our stock of the hour               because looking at shares of CarMax,               they are plunging after the company               reported a surprise drop in comparable               sales  We&re also

    in the financial markets as             kind of this race uh intensifies  Um             some of the other big players in this             are Alphabet, IBM and uh Microsoft  But             they said their most advanced uh quantum             processor attained a 34  improvement in             predicting how likely a bond trade will             uh a bond will        the during the              week already, but one um Micron, right?              Micron put up a tremendous beat and              raise uh after the close two days ago               Stock was up uh 13 bucks after hour,              wound up closing down yesterday and is              down is indicated down another two 3               this morning  So you        basically have a              darling stock uh in in the right place              in the right markets uh a play on              inference growth and AI buildout and              usage and you know blew        the doors off              the numbers beat by 30  and the stock              the    stock&s down right it&s an you know              it&s an expectations versus reality              situation the    stock had been a              tremendous performer and now it&s              correcting and it&s 10  off the        the doorstep of a 3 to 5  correction               I don&t think it&ll be much more than              that  In part because the New York Stock              Exchange advanced decline line has              continued to make new highs               Historically, prior to intermediate              pullbacks, in other words, the 7 to 10                            is likely  Um, but not much more than              that just based on market breath  And              again, for to get, you know, 30               declines in the stock market, you need              the either a big-time event or you need              the economy going into a recession  And              we don&t really have signs      
   which is flat, maybe we get             back there  So, if we&re back at 44 in             the 10-year, where do you think the             stock market is? Especially if the data             is come like like like you know, if the             data is okay here, you know, we see that        , all that sort of stuff &quot; Heads              down building this thing  What the              investor base was doing, what investors              in general were doing with the stock,              that&s another story  And you know, we              make this case all the time  It&s like,              okay, it&s one thing if       bring down the revenue              expectations of US tech companies  So              there there are a couple things that a              lot of this hype especially in stock              prices has depended on remaining true               If those things do not remain true, then              I think you go over that peak and and                     you go through this period of like, oh              my gosh, it it&s over or you know, the              the stock valuations are over               &gt;&gt; Well, I I think it&s more market related              than actually as it relates to, you              know, and and        over again that shows the proportion              of returns attributable to earnings              growth and then the proportion              attributable to multiple expansion  This              is a stock that would fall into that              multiple expansion piece, at least that              big spike up and some of what we&re              seeing now, giving back        one              of the things that that that&s a great              example of just an you know irrational              sort of move that the the stock was              trading I think at like three times the              value of its Bitcoin that it holds  And              it&s just interesting to me       It&s just broken that uptrend that&s              been in place since uh late 2023  That&s              just a technical thing  We know the              stock is always well expensive to the              retail group to the market that sort of              thing  What do you think a 13  um you              know                     really well through that inflationary              phase because they were lowerc cost              providers to consumers and it was              helpful and I think that their stock              prices responded and and rightfully so              they were rewarded for that and and if              there was good inventory management even              better right they       They invested in              Cororeweave, which is a NeoCloud, which              is a company um that basically um              creates these data centers that a              company like Microsoft will use when              they need excess capacity  They sign              long-term deals  So, Nvidia is an              investor there  Nvidia is now investor              um      
   you&re supervised learning  You              already know that um the outcome for              tomorrow for you know going back a week               You&re looking at stock  You can already              have like the graph of what the next day              looks like  So you have an answer for              it               And                      Um where anything that you predict is              going to return more than a certain              amount of money  Um the error for that              stock that you&ve had in the past, you              put those in buckets and suddenly you              start putting the creating these              buckets  You realize       off this today                But at least you can give an eye you can               give a step forward in how to start               processing something like stock prices                a very valid use for machine learning in               today&s markets  Use case implementation               of LSTM                Let&s dive in         at the open               price  We&re not looking at how many               volumes were traded  Like I was pointing               out earlier when we talk about stock,               just right off the bat, there&s six               columns  There&s open, high, low, close,               volume  Then there&s whether uh        low,               adjusted close  They have a special               formula to predict exactly what it would               really be worth based on the value of               the stock  And then from there, there&s               all kinds of other stuff you can put in               here  So, we&re only looking at one        did this for this particular               example  Um but I do this a lot when I&m               working with series and and specifically               in stock data  I wanted to iterate               through the first set of 30 data before               it does anything  Um I would have to               look deeper       do? Well,               let&s list out the things neural               networks can do for you  Translate text                Boy, we got Google Translate and               Microsoft has their own translate  They               have some really cool  They actually               have an earpiece  It&s supposed to start               translating as you talk          need to               give it a prompt to find out real Google               images from uh Google search results and               add them instead of the stock               thumbnails  Now let&s quickly go through               Galaxy or you know any Android phone  So               it&s just it works just pretty         instructions making it easy to follow               and your best part is to start small               build apps that solve specific problems               like booking appointments managing stock               or helping with sales and guess what you               can even create apps that people pay               monthly for  Now let&s talk about money

    their nav  And um they might want             to buy Ethereum under 4,000 which would             require dilution and that could             obviously hurt the stock price today as             well              So that is definitely something to think             about today as we look at what happens             with um with BMR                    Openey to approximately 22 4 billion               Okay, so Cororee expanding the              partnership they established a couple of              weeks ago with OpenAI  That stock is              down 3 3   You got a little bit of a              green candle right there  Makes sense              that they&re continuing to work with                     the stage for ambitions this week in              terms of data center capex buildout and              they need help  And whether it&s a              Microsoft with Nebius, whether it&s an              OpenAI with Cororeweave, whether it&s a              Google with Terowolf and now Cipher,              both that used         the same day they decided to              raise some money  So, I mean, look, it              probably makes sense to raise some              money  Their stock is doing very well               They just got this Google partnership,              but yeah, you can&t blame them for              taking advantage of this and and       with the video              and I think that was the most important              thing  So you&re starting to see that              continue to play out  Meta stock right              here in the pre-markets  This thing is              753              down about              down about 1   Will nuclear power the              data centers?        get margin call, you don&t              have the cash to deal with the margin              call  So that therefore you have to sell              your stock to pay back the margin  That              creates more selling pressure and it              could get really ugly  If the bull              market continues, which I       ago, but this is just to remind              people  This is from Goldman Sachs  What              December 1999 looked like versus              currently right now in the stock market               That was a good one  currently right               That was that was a good flow  Uh as you              can see the highest                     now to buy some              Ethereum, which is great for buying              Ethereum at these levels  Not the best              for shareholders because obviously the              stock&s going to take a little bit of a              hit  And the question just becomes, is              there enough energy to consume a lot of        up 2                These are some of the products that I do              think going into 2026 are worth looking              at  Uh probably not the specific stock              ones, but like the indicy ones, whether              it&s short, QQQ, TLT, etc  These are              definitely names that just from a                   
   , tough out this technical             storm together  So, uh, be nice  Be             nice  Be nice  With all that being said,             here&s a little lucky seed  Stock             futures are Well, that is very much not             true  They need to get this intern             fired  SW 500 futures declined for a             third day as                    sizable movement  So, how can you use             that? You might be thinking, &quot;Okay,             Matt, that&s not useful at all  You&re             telling me the stock market can go up or             down &quot; Yeah, it it can  And I understand             on the surface level how that&s not             helpful  But if you        is there&s a very              good chance in a couple quarters that              instead of just having a Friday              expiration for the Mag 7, Apple, Tesla,              Microsoft, Media, uh, Nvidia, Amazon,              those ones, there&s a good chance that              for the options, it&s going to the              market&s going to open        about to              kiss its breakdown level  Apple&s              actually somewhat green today  Nvidia              fake out breakout  Meta, it&s pushing              its recent lows as well  Microsoft, same              thing  Uh, we&re kind of in that danger              territory, but also you could argue              we&re just at support  And when you come        took a bit of              a hit right there  Broadcom took a              little bit of a hit  Coin, no  Coreweave              is looking bullish  Hood, tiny hit               Microsoft, tiny hit               Not Micro Strategy, not Meta, not              Netflix  Nvidia took a hit right there              at 951               Oracle was recovering, took a little bit              of        SPY a little bit more bullish               So, not everything is lining up to be              purely bearish  The large players are              net selling the New York Stock Exchange              this morning  As of right now, I am not              necessarily thinking the odds of this              reversal are the highest  What time is              it?

I mean, I&m not Joseph here, but uh              where is Sofi here?              You can be Joseph today               Yeah  Uh,                     be liquidated or you&re just looking to              exit              that  There&s no like there&s no reason              why you would want a stock to go up              significantly today and still own it              because it will become extremely              overvalued  Then what&s the point to own              it      
    bring it back up              That&s what we&d be looking for  Okay,             now moving forward  Let&s quickly just             go and look in the stock market itself             to understand where we are  Not that             screen  Here we go  So, let&s go over to             the NASDAQ  Seeing where we are        market,              lock in some yields  The bonds start to              move up, and then investors see the bond              market rising, the yields are going              down, the stock market starts to climb              back up again  The volatility index ends              up taking a reversal back down again               They&ve hedged themselves, and then it       process repeats              itself               That&s really how it works  going into              Nvidia  That thing&s gapping down              towards the open  Tesla gapping down               Microsoft              not really doing too much there  Google              gapping down  It&s getting ready to              close this gap over here               Apple holding out  I mean       , stock bond              ratio says that stocks are overvalued,              you know, and you should be welcoming              this  You should be welcoming this,              ladies and gentlemen               when you can              understand the bigger picture of things              and what&s going on, then you can say,              okay, the overall perspective says that              the stock market is overvalued  So,              whenever I see a reversal to the upside,              I know it might be short-lived  All              right? So just you know

Do they have Oh, there               was one there       ,               really cool  But what I was get what I               was getting at here was that uh their               presentation like I because I watched               the Microsoft uh the keynote where they               they sort of announced all these things               and showed them off  Their presentation               is awful  They&re so bad at         Even the               goddamn Apple Pencil, which is a               ridiculous thing, but let&s not get into               that  But they make you excited about               it  Microsoft is not quite there yet in               terms of presentation, but they have               they have the hardware, so that&s pretty               cool  Uh, what was I       research more stocks                You also need to level up your skills               significantly  So, let&s go do that                Let&s uh let&s get the stock research               first because that&s going to be the               easiest  Uh research stocks  I wonder               how my my  5,000 investment is going to                      you know what?

   on            Friday when they&ll announce the price            of this thing  Damn             &gt;&gt; But Miranda, we we did in fact get some            bad news from Microsoft on a Friday            after we put out our Thursday morning            episode last week             &gt;&gt; Yep             &gt;&gt; And well, would would you would you do                    your head because that&s what we&re             going to be doing this whole episode             basically  I like gez guys              So, okay, Xbox says, Microsoft says the             price increases are occurring, quote,             due to changes in the macroeconomic             environment, which is a chicken way             of saying tariffs  Yep                           &gt;&gt; Number one,             let&s ask the question, will Sony follow             suit again? They did eventually do so             with the first price hike  Microsoft             raising prices back in May  Uh that&s             why I traded in my launch day PS5 for a             PS5 Pro in anticipation of Grand Theft       to             look into this, but basically a deep             dive on             what&s causing this issue  It&s like, is             there not enough stock currently in the             United States of Series X&s that they             expect             will sell for them to justify raising             prices again because they have       have to raise any             prices, you know, like we&re not paying             the tariffs on these goods cuz we             already have them in stock here in the             United States, so prices don&t need to             change &quot; So that&s my question is like,             why are prices being       old project that we&ve had             for so many years now? Like are             &gt;&gt; is that such a problem that they&re like             running out of stock in places? So, I             think that&s a little bit of my             &gt;&gt; concern with seeing like a second price             hike here, you know?        as              it was what it was  So the the you know              speaking of conspiracies theories is              are these tariffs a convenient excuse              for Microsoft and and perhaps Sony if              they follow suit to try to rake in more              profits? Uh and and the reason I bring              that        that I hate Xbox even              though I do an Xbox podcast every week               But no, I I&m bringing this up because a              former Microsoft executive who has              shipped Xbox consoles, who has launched              Xbox systems in the past, he brought it              up, Mike Ibara, who most        be is a far far deeper issue              versus the tariff excuse  So those are              Mike Ibara&s words  Obviously, he hasn&t              worked at Microsoft in some time  He&s              not privy to their strategies and              conversations now with these price              increases  But coming from him, I think                   
   internet regulator has banned domestic             firms from buying Nvidia&s AI chips,             including the sought after RTX Pro             6000D  The reaction was instant              Nvidia&s stock dropped 3  in a single             day  On the surface, that figure might             not seem dramatic  But when you realize             that China represents 1/8 of        has             imposed a  100,000 annual fee on H1B             visas, the very program US companies use             to hire global talent  Tech giants like             Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel             rely heavily on these visas to bring in             engineers, researchers, and developers             from abroad  By suddenly raising the             cost of every H1B worker      enrollment could fall, weakening another             pillar of US competitiveness              The impact is already visible inside             major companies  Leaked memos from             Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Goldman             Sachs instruct H1B employees to avoid             leaving the United States  Amazon&s             guidance was blunt  If you are in the             US, stay        put, even if you had travel             planned  Microsoft issued a nearly             identical warning  The fear is that if             workers travel abroad, they might not be             allowed back without paying the enormous             new fee      
    the           buildout&s happening, it&s not just           about Nvidia chips, but when you look           what&s happened with OpenAI, you look at           ultimately Oracle, Microsoft, I mean,            now you&re really seeing this            multiplier  And I believe that will            separate the winners from the            pretenders  And I think investors, it       &s            a stock pickers market, especially when            it comes to tech  So in terms and I know            you you&ve got your own product as well            where you       , in 2023,             2024, no matter who I met, where in the             world, it&s like, okay, you have             breakfast, lunch, dinner, and you buy             Nvidia stock  That that&s what you do              But now it&s spread  Look, you look at             Intel  I mean, they got a lifeline,             right? It was        is underestimating             where growth is and I&ve always said if             you look at just valuation over one year             you&ve missed every transformational             growth stock the last 20 years right and             that&s the bears when they&re in             hibernation mode they don&t see that in             the spreadsheets and

   ,             Amazon Web Services probably not growing             18, but growing 22   I mean, we don&t             even know how to the convoluted nature             of OpenAI and Microsoft as Azure  Maybe             you figure that out  I&m not there  But             then David Tesla  Okay              &gt;&gt; Yeah  Yeah              &gt;&gt; Adas and you&re going to hear        software,             the physical AI, the sovereign AI area,             there&s a lot of growth to come              &gt;&gt; Why do you say that Nvidia is a musthown             stock for everyone? Well, look, this is             not an earthshattering rea revelation             because this is a household name now              It&s the 800 pound gorilla in        investment in             Intel now hundred billion dollar             agreement with uh open AI  So, they are             doing everything  So, a lot of people             already own this stock, but for the             viewers who are sitting there watching             right now who may not own it,             &gt;&gt; that&s me              &gt;&gt; All right  So, this is you        times forward             multiple, growing earnings at 40              annually over the course of the next             several years  Those are the             expectations  It is cheap  It the stock             price could double from here and it             would still be cheap relative to the S&amp;P             500  Incredibly inexpensive  So, if             you&re sitting at        cost average overtime the rest              That&s the best way to do it so you             don&t get caught with your pants down             and the stock&s 175 bucks right now              Next week it&s 150 and you&re kicking             yourself for overpaying              &gt;&gt; I do I do a deal  I will                    &gt;&gt; you like dividend payers or or st more             stable companies?             &gt;&gt; I like the stocks I&ve already got that             have done very well for me  Microsoft             and Blackstone, you know,             &gt;&gt; they&re great and we own those too              &gt;&gt; I can&t sell them because I can&t pay             the the uh      
    and           and I I built that premise on the fact           that I&m recognizing that there are six            companies, seven companies that are            supporting this stock market  They are            the people who are spending, it&s            estimated that to be  3 trillion between            now and 2030 on building the data            centers        I            realized is that there is a point at            which they stop spending  And when that            spending stops, who&s going to support            the resulting stock market? Okay? And            and and just think of it  um they&re            spending somewhere in the neighborhood            of 400 billion a year  When that gets         And then I read in the Wall            Street this weekend that uh the city of            Seattle is saying as a result of Amazon            and and Microsoft not hiring more people            and in fact laying off people  Our real            estate market is collapsing and and our            our our banks are having um        document              I know what I&m going to do and I know             the signals that will tell me when it&s             time to vacate the stock market  I             decided I needed to share this  I need             to share it with the 10,00 people who             have supported Best of Us Investors        the signals             you will see  And I will share those             signals with you on my discord and on my             private videos and on my Friday stock             talk as we move forward because this             market will crash because somebody has             to replace the expenditures of the six             hyperscalers             and it&s not

    fell  That prompted           investors to ask me, &quot;What do I think            about the situation? And do I think AMD            stock is a buy right now?&quot; I&ll answer            that question in this video  I&ll share            with you the details I&m        utilizing to            make that estimate and make this uh            rating for AMD stock  Let&s jump right            into it  After a brief message from my            sponsor,            &gt;&gt; I want to thank the Mly Full for            sponsoring        to theme             parks, restaurants, etc  And that             created a gap for sales of the products             that AMD benefits from like Sony             PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox, laptops,             computers, etc  But since that initial             pullback, the market is recovering and             there&s going to be a huge replacement             cycle       share in             critically important categories  I think             this is an undervaluation  However, it&s             also trading at almost the same price as             Nvidia stock  So, I&ve been saying, you             know, if you&re in the market and you&re             trying to decide between one of these                    two, I&ve thought Nvidia has been the             better stock this year  So, looking at             my discounted cash flow valuation for             AMD, which calculates a fair value for             the        intrinsic value per share I have at              150 for AMD  Current market price is             161  So accounting for a margin of             safety, AMD stock looks fairly valued on             my DCF basis and then undervalued on the             forward PE basis  So overall, I can say             it&s slightly undervalued         And for a             business of AMD&s caliber, I&d be happy             to pay a fair value for this stock for             this business  So I&ve had AMD    stock             rated as a buy all year long  And in             fact, it was on my list of one of the         I felt like             it was a great value, an absolute             bargain  Now, I don&t I&m not as bullish             on AMD stock  I don&t think it&s a great             value  I don&t think it&s an absolute             bargain  I think it&s a        good value  I             think it&s a good deal  I think if             investors buy AMD stock today and hold             for five or 10 years, I think they&ll             make a good return on their investment              So, I have this        stock rated as a buy and             I updated that recommendation today  Hey             everyone  So many of you have been             asking about my investing strategy

    cuckoo            portfolio is the fund overlap  Now, VO            and CukQ overlap at 51   So, while VO&s            got the top 500 companies on the US            stock market, CookQ has the NASDAQ 100,            which is the top 100 non-financials on            the NASDAQ 100  So, you have a            combination of the top        funds  So you have a 51             overlap and that overlap is usually with            a lot of the Mac 7 as in we have Nvidia,            Apple, Microsoft, we have Tesla, Amazon,            all these great companies all together,            but you&re not just diversify and you&re            actually just adding more of the        has a cheaper expense ratio and it             tracks the same index  So, you&re             getting broad exposure to the top 500             companies on the US stock market  Now,             fund number two is going to be VGT,             which is the Vanguard Information             Technology ETF  Now, it&s got a share             price around
