   and             saved me the most heartache is this when             in doubt zoom out that means don&t just             look at near-term Price action yes             Nvidia stock is down 20  over the last             month but it&s still up by over             450  in the last 2 years and 70  in the                    last year alone and if you actually look             at this price chart for more than a             second you&ll see that Nvidia stock has             actually dropped by 20   three other             times over the past year that&s             basically once per quarter now let me             show you a        of the same price             chart except this time it&s showing             Enid&s draw Downs the top of this chart             is 0  which means Nvidia stock reached a             new high and was 0  off of its peak             everything below zero is how far the             price has dropped from that Peak        it&s dropped by 30  12 separate             times which means it had to recover by             almost 50  to reach a new high all 12             times Nvidia stock dropped by 50  five             separate times which means it needed to             double all five times just to break even             and it crashed by 80         break even and it did             recover but it took over 5 years just in             time for the Global financial crisis of             2007 and 2008 where Nvidia stock fell by             over 80  again except this time instead             of hitting a new high after half a             decade it was still down by around         to             finally put my money where my mouth was             and make videos explaining why I             disagreed then in the summer of 2022             when when Nvidia stock hit the same             price as when they first announced their             a100 gpus and kathywood was still             selling it I decided to call it quits on        to earnings ratio is near a 5year low             making this a dip I&m happy to buy and             before I share my current outlook on             Nvidia stock here are a couple more             quick tips that really help me out as a             full-time investor first doing nothing             is usually a great option       right answer is             doing nothing and time in the market             beats timing the market have helped me             stay in and even double down on Nvidia             stock and paler    stock and many other             great stocks that I cover each week             speaking of which I said I&d tell you my             latest long-term         demand Trump&s tariffs might cause some             short-term pain but they&re not a             serious long-term concern and Jensen             Wong will keep selling Nvidia stock as             he should but as long as those sales are             tiny fractions of his overall Holdings             and they&re automated the scary             headlines will do      
  you got to be flipping my flapjacks have           a look at that folks Nvidia stock price           down           177  in one trading day and the company           didn&t even come out with earnings the            damage was extensive here today Oracle                  price           down           177  in one trading day and the company           didn&t even come out with earnings the            damage was extensive here today Oracle            stock down 14 percentage points here            today broadcom which doesn&t get talked                  got got some sub subjects to speak            about here today first off I&m going to            share my thoughts on Nvidia is this a            buy the dip opportunity on this    stock            what&s going on here I&ll share all my            in-depth thoughts on this one SM has            been        these opportunities             pass by year after year after year right             all right so here&s a deal folks Nvidia             now if you don&t know my history around                Nvidia I owned the    stock many years ago             I bought it kind of like the end of 2018             going into 2019 it was                   incredible opportunity at that time a             lot of tech stocks were getting the             hammered right I made some short-term             money on Nvidia and sold out then I             owned the    stock in 2024 made a bunch             more short-term money I think I made             like 50  or something crazy on       get cut in half or more which             means there could be 50  plus downside             in Nvidia stock but before you run to             that conclusion you know be careful             running to that conclusion right because             if    Nvidia keeps growing and growing like             that&s never that&s not going to happen             right         you&re going to have to             pay such a crazy premium because also             everybody&s confused on what&s going to             happen here with Nvidia stock over the             next few weeks or the next couple months             and so therefore if you buy call options             or put options you&re probably       of your             profitability so the moral of story is I             don&t want to do anything with Nvidia             nothing is interesting to me in regards             to    Nvidia at the moment if maybe the                stock Falls a ton more then maybe it&s             interesting as a buy for me right um if                    today like you you look at the             nasdaq&s a disaster today you&re looking             at Nvidia the most important    stock in             the    stock market for the past two and a             half years uh the    stock down 17  in the             day and yet meta was like oh oh what             happened oh oh        now the reason I believe there&s very              limited downside risk in AMD so              obviously we spoke about Nvidia it&s              like yeah if    Nvidia blah blah blah              happens you know could the    stock fall 50              plus per  there definitely a potential I              think there&s very limited downside              potential in

    Intel             would always be considered amd&s two             main rivals or two main competitors             right so  100,000 into Nvidia stock 10             years ago is now worth  26 million which             is ridiculous right  100,000 into AMD is             worth  4 6 million so        I understand 4 6             million is not 26 million but who&s beat             a Nvidia stock in the past 10 years like                Nvidia stock might be the best             performing 10year    stock in the entire                stock market like it&s a one1 freak             situation I&m sorry but  100,000 into             4       Revenue year that&s             pretty darn impressive like what she&s             doing here is very very impressive now             that shows you the performance of Nvidia             over time right and how their revenue is             trended over time but what about             recently wow we had some very important             things        going on here recently I have to             show you guys there&s basically four             segments of nvidia&s business there two             entree businesses which are the big dogs             right and there&s two side dish             businesses what we&re looking         accelerating and accelerating for             several years in a row it usually means             great things for the stock price it&s             usually a very fun time to be an             investor of that company now    Nvidia went             through that cycle where their their             revenue kept accelerating accelerating             unfortunately that&s now        over for NVIDIA             so    Nvidia is kind of unfortunately for             them they&ve entered a no fund stage the             no fund stage doesn&t mean you can&t             make money in the    stock it&s just it&s             harder to get the        gains because now             people start looking at the revenue             growth and it keeps going down on a             percentage basis right so Nvidia next             year maybe they grow Revenue I mean         AMD is going to be the hot one that             everybody&s going to want to flock to             because they got the accelerating growth             in Nvidia unfortunately will have the             decelerating growth rates quite             substantially especially over this next             two years now right now another thing we             need to       just have no serious competitors at              that point in time AMD is really the              only company in the whole Marketplace              who can really give Nvidia competition              at this point in time right so the moral              story is there&s there&s ways to play              this if you&re

   to give you a different frame             of mind I want to actually pin it             against the big dog Nvidia the most             respected company in the space right and             you know    Nvidia stock I&ve obviously             made tremendous amount of money on this             over this past year right I&m        completely             out of my Nvidia position now at this             point in time but there&s a reason I&m             buying AMD over    Nvidia right now because                    s another frame of thought to think             about right this is from the Q4 2022             bottom right since that time Nvidia             stock is up             1,100  AMD is up 140     Nvidia 100              deserves the the the move it&s made here             some people call that a bubble not if                     to be played in 2025 2026 and             into 2027 when it comes to AMD stock             versus    Nvidia and I&m not necessarily             thinking that    Nvidia is going to crash             and it&s like oh my gosh    nvidia&s like             down 50  or something crazy right I just             believe amd&s       2025 and 2026             are going to be the years of             AMD like I said not like it&s impossible             to make money on Nvidia stock over the             next few years but I just believe like             like kind of I would look at it the same             as you        looked at the last two years in             regards to Nvidia vers AMD last 2 years             it&s like could you have made money in             AMD sure there was some money to be made                    but where there was a huge money to be             made it was to be made in Nvidia right                Nvidia got out there first they got             their AI chips in the market first they             beat AMD at the punch AMD you know                    lagging in regards to that right now             it&s catchup time and so I believe the             big money is going to be made in AMD             stock        over this next couple years versus             Nvidia because you&re going to have the             emetic growth you&re going to have the             gaming get back to growth       overall and so overall I             think you&re going to see 25 26 really             be the years of AMD versus the years of             Nvidia right and once again that&s not             saying there&s not money to be made             there now I believe so you might say       
    do overall yeah so              nbdl is very simply the 2x Nvidia ETF in              other words it is a leverage single                 stock ETF that&s designed to provide two              times the return the daily return of                 Nvidia stock stock so as of today              obviously very much the talking point        of              the market um maybe maybe the entire              stock market uh as    Nvidia has just              released its              earnings and then of course when it        a friend at the New              York Stock Exchange as well it doesn&t              really get any better than that we&ll              put the link in the chat here              momentarily we&re about eight minutes or              so away from      Exchange as well it doesn&t              really get any better than that we&ll              put the link in the chat here              momentarily we&re about eight minutes or              so away from nvidia&s earnings calls              don&t go       National Institute of              advanced industrial science and              technology is building its AI bridging              Cloud infrastructure 3 0 supercomputer              with              Nvidia We Believe Sovereign AI Revenue              will reach low double digigit billions              this              year the Enterprise AI wave is started              Enterprises also drove sequential       to build custom llama              3 1 models for both its own use and to              assist clients seeking to deploy              generative AI              applications Nvidia Nims accelerate and              simplify model deployment companies              across Healthcare energy Financial              Services Retail transportation and              Telecommunications are      thriving              platforms and increased demand for AI              cockpit              Solutions at the consumer at the              computer vision and pattern recognition              conference Nvidia won the autonomous              Grand Challenge in the end to end              driving at scale category outperforming              more than 400 entries              worldwide Boston Dynamics be         slows developers must must accelerate              everything possible accelerated              Computing starts with Cuda X libraries              new libraries open new markets for              NVIDIA we released many new libraries              including could accelerate polers pandas              and Spark the leading data science and              data processing libraries CVS for Vector        yearly of csp&s cloud capacity and              countries are recognizing the importance              of AI and investing in Sovereign AI              infrastructure and Nvidia Ai and    Nvidia              Omniverse is opening up the next era of              AI General              Robotics and now the Enterprise AI wave              has started and       
    earnings we&ll be taking a look           at the full numbers here giving a            breakdown segment by segment and why the            stock is going down even though    Nvidia            beat on both the earnings per share and            the revenue Salesforce also reported            today this is one of the companies I own            it was                   and how these earnings have affected my            performance now let&s first go ahead and            jump into the headline news here Nvidia            just reported earnings and so far the               stock has been bouncing around up and            down a little bit but overall in the red            in the red from anywhere of 3        150  increase             year-over-year so they beat their             expectations but we still get a muted             response from investors so what does             this mean for NVIDIA why are investors             becoming less enthused about this    stock             why is it trading down when they beat on             every metric possible I believe it&s             because       &re reporting and the expectations             are becoming closer and closer together             meaning that the alpha in the stock is             becoming more and more narrow the             earnings reports are becoming more muted             expectations of    Nvidia are now so close             to what they&re actually reporting that             it&s difficult to find as much        a             high starting valuation that&s more             likely to lead to multiple compression             than expansion if we rewind time 3 years             ago Nvidia was in the best situation the                stock had accelerating Revenue growth in             fact massively accelerating Revenue             growth it had margins expanding and it             had a low starting valuation everything        down             they started with a 78  gross margin             which is down 3  quarter over quarter so             I don&t say any of this to bash Nvidia             stock I think it&s one of the most             incredible companies in the market today             and it&s one of the most amazing Stories             over the        are             pricing in but we can say definitively             with this report that the upside in the             stock today is far less than it was a             year ago the future expected returns are             far lower    Nvidia will trade closer to             expectations and it&ll be harder to get             gains out of this company        when I look at the earnings             reports of any of these companies with             Salesforce and crowd strike they seem             rather mundane Nvidia seems to be the             most shocking one that the    stock isn&t             going crazy after earnings and I think             that&s the single biggest development of             this earning season up      
                  Okay, so the knock valuation, the knock              speculation  What about the knock of              concentration? Nvidia has the biggest              weight in the S&amp;P 500 of any individual                 stock since 1981, since data was being              collected  The largest 10  of US stocks              now account for 76  of total US market                     some point in 2026  I think people              start to get really concerned about              Nvidia&s ability to grow revenues 20               plus clip and that&s when things are              going to get really shaky for Amazon                 stock for like about a 2 to threeyear              period like Amazon will get a become        a              really shaky stock for two to three              years not like you know it&s not going              to just be like oh it&s two to three              months of craziness no no it&s going to              be multi-year             years not like you know it&s not going              to just be like oh it&s two to three              months of craziness no no it&s going to              be multi-year              you know Nvidia shaking around and              downtrending essentially       for like two to              three years But, you know, that&s              another one like, could you get more,              you know, skyrocketing to happen in              Nvidia in the short term? Sure  You              know, come out with another banger              quarter, another banger guide, right?              You&re good  But as soon         be another extreme like record,              okay? Which going to set the bar even              higher  And so if you think it&s not              possible for Nvidia to have revenues go              down maybe in 27 or 28, listen, it&s              very possible  Is it a guarantee? No               But I&m       be in this state of like they can never              imagine Nvidia&s revenues going down in              2728  Listen, man  I I&ve I&ve either              held    Nvidia stock or tracked this    stock              for you know now probably going on 12              years uh for    Nvidia right I&ve been in              the market for what        16 years now or so              but terms of Nvidia probably been              tracking this one or owning this one        on              and off for 12 years now right              listen I&ve seen plenty of these cycles              in regards to Nvidia and people are like              oh no this cycle is different like this              is the one that just goes up forever and              ever and        they never stop no trust me              like like no eventually Nvidia will              flatline line revenues or those revenues              will go down  Um the bit the only              question is what year does it happen? Is       
               up smaller companies especially in areas            of AI and gaming and other things that            Nvidia has of course huge expertise in            which they in return get    stock in these            companies well given the billions of            dollars in profit that    Nvidia has been            raking in especially more recently their            profits have been really skyrocketing        actually much             higher now given that AI stocks have             really been soaring this year but uh             running through them from smallest to             largest holding for Nvidia stock number             one is going to be Nano X Imaging ticker             symbol             nnx which in videoid revealed a stake in             worth over              380,000 now as                    negative record of almost  47 million             loss over the past year alone and while             the stock is technically down a giant             amount from the top it&s also risen by             almost 50  this year after    Nvidia             revealed their position in it and uh you             know a ton of new hype and excitement        the future             though but for now it&s going to be a             pass from me uh moving on to stock             number two though we have Tu simple             Holdings ticker simple tsph which    Nvidia             owns over uh  3 million of and if you             thought that Nano was speculative well             with uh too simple        both an investor and as a             partner should only help them achieve             you know even more goals in the future             too but after nvidia&s position was             revealed the    stock skyrocketed to almost             a 200  gain just this year alone and             because they&re not yet profitable all             we can really look        the largest one of all and so coming             in here at stock number five             but we have none other than arm Holdings             ticker symbol armm which    Nvidia owned             around  147 million of and this one is             definitely the most closely aligned to                   owned             around  147 million of and this one is             definitely the most closely aligned to             Nvidia in the world of processing chips             in fact arm is        and so             they kind of blocked it there and thus             Nvidia has had to kind of resort to just             doing smaller Partnerships with them             while also investing in the    stock             instead now arm only recently IED last             year and so far the    stock has been a             very strong performer currently up over             15        and larger over              time but for me personally I do have a a              few kind of personal issues is that I              already own Nvidia stock I own Intel                 stock not to mention like I don&t know              Google and BYU and even Tesla also              develop you know chips as well so for me      
   that            wants to introduce some image generation            or text a video or 3D to video is going            to be built on nvidia&s platform now            remember    Nvidia also did release a new            supercomputer which is going to be            powering every single piece of this AI            software and it        see right here            that there are three main companies that            are going to be building the rest of            their generative AI platforms on Nvidia            and these aren&t just small companies            either these are huge companies so one            of the companies that you can see right                                now that is partnering with Nvidia it&s             going to be absolutely insane they&re             also partnering with Adobe and later on             in this video I&ll talk about how             exactly Adobe is going to be another      absolutely insane they&re             also partnering with Adobe and later on             in this video I&ll talk about how             exactly Adobe is going to be another key             player as an AI stock but there&s a lot                    of factors that people don&t realize now             the reason this is so crazy is because             Nvidia actually does have some key             competitive advantages they have the             single best        hand data on how to             actually train their models which is             going to be really really cool because             Nvidia is literally poised in the best             position now where does the    Nvidia stock             sit in a terms of technical analysis             this is something that I always like to             quickly do        as especially on the four             hourly time frame because it allows you             to understand exactly where the stock is             going to be and exactly        where the stock             is going to go now right now    Nvidia             isn&t really at a position that I would             be comfortable buying at but then the        do think that Nvidia             could hit another all-time high but             would I buy right now definitely is in a             very very odd position simply because of             all those green bars now of course      definitely is in a             very very odd position simply because of             all those green bars now of course I do             technical analysis for quite some time             before making these stock predictions so                    they&re able to do do this it&s going to             be pretty crazy you can see right here             it says Nvidia is partnering with    stock             asset Library shut    stock to build new AI             based tools that will enable users to             generate custom 3D models simply by             typing text in      
     Oh my gosh, all this stuff  Right            here we are  It&s another time period             Nvidia is reporting earnings this week             Oh my gosh, everybody&s talking about            it  Is    Nvidia stock going to crash the            market? The same fear that they have            quarter in and quarter out  Is        Nvidia            going to do it? Is    Nvidia going to crash            a market? It&s like waking up every day                   out of            100  today  Why did I do it? We&ll get            into that  Some big commentary around            that  Okay  Two, Nvidia  Is    Nvidia going            to crash the market this time around?            We&ve all been waiting  We&re all             looking at the casket  Maybe today&s        in the right              direction  So there&s new kind of              excitement around Nvidia in regards to              this  People are going to be like              excited about that  So that&s definitely              going to help the    stock, you know,              regardless of what happens because              people lean back on        so this just              something to kind of keep in mind  Now              in regards to the stock, could it crash              the market, the fundamentals, right?              Here&s the thing with    Nvidia  The issue              with    Nvidia is not this quarter they&re              about to report or even next quarter  If              those                    earnings, right? It&s going to hit the              cues hard that day  Is it going to crash              the whole market? No  Because Nvidia is              a one-off standalone company that&s just              benefiting massively from other massive              tech companies spending a fortune  If              those companies like        little more with              AMD over the next few years  So then AMD              stock continues to rocket higher during              that particular time and maybe    Nvidia is              a little weaker  But will    Nvidia crash              the whole    stock market? No, doesn&t work              like that  So, you know, cuz it&s a                     whole it&s a whole different phenomenon              in regards to what&s going on with              Nvidia right now  So,        but you know, I              think there will there are risk involved              with Nvidia      
    a lot of the gains that            you already have so this is the most            important week for NVIDIA and look mark            my words what&s going to happen is               NVIDIA will beat earnings but the    stock            won&t rise too much because expectations            already baked in I&m going to show you a       &s more investors looking to buy             calls that&s because there&s more Bulls             on Nvidia than Bears that&s very             interesting and that&s one of the             warning signs that I have for a    stock             that may be reaching a peak and that&s             why I said that you know basically        mark             my words I think that Nvidia will have             good earnings but it won&t rise more             than 10  and that        blind to when a stock             pulls back that&s not me I&m always             looking for upside opportunity but I&m             also looking for pullbacks I&m also             looking to hedge and I&m looking to be       for upside opportunity but I&m             also looking for pullbacks I&m also             looking to hedge and I&m looking to be             smart with my money right so when it             comes to Nvidia I have a few        call right away that cash enters             your account immediately however now you             may lose your shares if the stock goes             above the strike price right so in this             example or this position if    Nvidia were             to go to 150 155 I would lose my shares             I don&t want that so I        the call option so there is a             whole lot more call options and I am             bullish on Nvidia I do think             expectations are priced then so when we             do get the good earnings the    stock will             go up but it&s not going to pop up like             huge amounts okay I&d        be happy if it             does don&t get me wrong if Nvidia goes             to 160 170 great but that is not what I        the longer term I             would say that it is smarter to buy uh             an option on Nvidia to really get in             behind    Nvidia and to ride ride the             earnings drift to ride the momentum to             ride the    stock uh you know performing             very well so you can see how the implied             volatility here        on so I             would buy the 130 okay this will be             about  2800 which is much better than             paying  4,000 or  155,000 for Nvidia             stock if you were to buy 100 shares it&s             a lot better actually so this is a lot             cheaper it&s like a very small      
    button below and start            experiencing the benefits            as I shared with you in in the            introduction Nvidia stock is down by            over            15  on the back of this news    Nvidia            stock has lost hundreds of billions of             dollars of market capitalization in just             one day in fact if       trillion large             numbers indeed and it highlights the             riskiness of investing in tech stocks             like             Nvidia of course I&m disappointed in             this development because I&ve had    Nvidia             stock rated as one of my top stocks to             buy in 2025 in fact I had it rated        as a             top stock to buy last year as well 2025             is getting off to a rough start for                Nvidia stock             investors but why is    Nvidia stock down             by so much today well the semiconductor             Market is leading a         cash flows are             threatened and if you remember when I             did my discounted cash flow valuation of             Nvidia part of the reason why investors             are so attracted to    Nvidia stock is             because because its free cash flows are             expected to Surge over the next decade             rising from        business is             forecast to grow over these next 5 years             over these next 10             years so given this decline Nvidia stock             is now trading at a forward price to             earnings of             27 which signals to me that it&s still             undervalued        additionally if you look at             my discounted cash flow valuation model             Nvidia stock still looks relatively             cheap compared to my intrinsic value per             share calculation which forecasts that                Nvidia is free cash flows will grow             significantly over the next decade and             more and the                   longer term and even in that scenario             it&s intrinsic value would be              270 per share             so what&s my conclusion is Nvidia stock             a buy on this dip is this a buying             opportunity well I think it&s too soon             to come to the conclusion that         downside and so this downside reaction I             think is an overreaction to this             news but it does bring me to higher             alert on Nvidia stock I&m already paying             close attention to Amazon Microsoft and             all these companies that are spending             money on data centers and the recent         it&s too soon to make any kind of             conclusive change in my recommendation             so I&m still reiterating that I still             think Nvidia stock is a buy but put a             asterisk there to be more cautious             because the big tech companies Microsoft             Amazon alphabet will be rep      
   m convinced that Wall Street still           doesn&t understand Nvidia whether you&re           a longtime shareholder or you&re           thinking about buying    Nvidia stock for           the first time you should know that this           earnings call wasn&t about revenues or           profit margins    Nvidia just showed us why            it&s the king of        the entire AI era so in            this video I&ll break down everything            you need to know about nvidia&s latest            earnings and what that means for    Nvidia            stock in 2025 and beyond your time is            valuable so let&s get right into it as            always I&m         data centers I&ll            walk you through a few things that most            investors still don&t understand about            nvidia&s data center gpus I&ll share my            thoughts on    Nvidia stock and whether I&d            still buy it now that it&s the biggest            company on Earth by market cap        and of            course where Nvidia will end the year on            my list of stocks to get rich without            getting         posted earnings per share of            78 cents which is up 11  from last year            after accounting for their 10 for one            stock split this past summer    nvidia&s            data center segment is their biggest            business unit by far accounting for            about 88  of their total revenues today            another        sits on top of that             but now that you understand it at least             at a high level we can talk about the             future of Nvidia stock and if you feel             I&ve earned it consider hitting the like             button and subscribing to the channel             that really helps me out        like this             thanks and with that out of the way             here&s what I think is in store for             Nvidia stock in 2025 and Beyond like I             said earlier I think    Nvidia will be the             world&s first  4 trillion company their             revenue and earnings are still growing             by triple         that will change the way that             companies invest in Computing in the             first place just like Nvidia is doing             right now by disrupting the CPU Market              with their gpus on top of that    Nvidia              stock is still relatively cheap with a              forward price to earnings ratio lower              than their two main        competitors broadcom              and AMD as fast as their stock price has              gone up their earnings have gone up much              faster      
    a bigger company a             more successful company uh to like be a             successful stock and that&s just not how             this works at all AMD does not have to             beat    Nvidia AMD has to be a competitor             of    Nvidia and compete hard in the             markets but they don&t have to beat       the next 3 years uh or the             next 5 years we could even say for             instance I wouldn&t be surprised if if             Nvidia does fine as a    stock but I             wouldn&t be surprised if AMD is like             that Beast opportunity a much bigger             percentage Gainer over this next 3        to 5             years I think AMD is blow Nvidia out of             the water when as as somebody that was             an    Nvidia shareholder in the past right                    made a lot of money on that stock last             year right I&m completely out of             position now and the reason        being is not             because I don&t think there&s money to             be made in Nvidia that&s it&s definitely                    possible Nvidia can grow into a  5             trillion doll        under a 200 billion             dollar market cap which that makes AMD a             big Tech stock it&s just not part of the             trillion dollar boys club that you know             we all think about as meta Apple             Microsoft    Nvidia Amazon those sorts of             companies right but in my personal             opinion based upon        all the growth I see             for AMD over the next few years I             believe this stock price is going to             increase dramatically by 2030 and I                                 just looking at it from a simple             standpoint of like oh it doubled oh it             went up a lot is bad no different than             Nvidia Nvidia stock if you look at those             2022 lows it did the first then double             up in early 2023 right so it does a             quick 2x there      
   and soon enough we&re             going to lose more and more of course             Nvidia is the poster boy of the bubble             right now it will pop once it pops the             bubble ends the    stock market will crash             and you will never see the highs for             decades        and there             are similarities and I thought it was a             subject that is worth exploring the             recent action that we&ve seen in Nvidia             and many other stocks specifically             really large Camp stocks brought back             memories of 1999 the famous Y2K rally             and the headline         year 22 we&ve seen              normalization of net profit it went down              to about  4 billion so we&ve seen the              stock of    Nvidia peaking in 21 then              crashing down in the year 22 because it              was a reflection what the company&s              going to produce        cares about margins if they go higher              stocks go higher the margins go down              stocks go down suppose these were the              conditions of Nvidia before 23 then we              got the AI Mania all of a sudden we have              large companies stampeding to develop              their AI capabilities because        now              investors are putting a higher price on              AI they can&t do without nvidia&s              advanced chips which Nidia by the way              had these chips since 22 it was already              in the inventory the pricing was                    increasing Demand              with lack of Supply pricing goes higher              the combination of all of these things              makes margins explode higher with it              Nvidia stock also exploded higher what              usually happens after that and we&ve              seen that with Cisco to maintain this              demand to serve this        the economy              interest rates recession consumer demand              goes down this feedback now reaches              these big companies who are buying the              chips from Nvidia they begin to see that              their numbers are going down because of              the weakness of the economy so they              stopped they pulled        almost 37  Google was up almost 42               Apple 2007 was up almost over 120               Research In Motion AKA Blackberry was              the equivalent of Nvidia today that              stack was up almost over 140  Amazon up              more than 140  you see the concentration              of gains in the technology sector         gaining some momentum and if you&re              a momentum Trader you&re probably              chasing those kind of names you&re              switching from Nvidia to Taiwan for              example there are 7 million ways to              benefit from bubbles there are those who              chase them stop at the       
    going            through ELF and everything that&s            massive going on there, we&re going to            talk about Nvidia, the    stock that            matters more than pretty much any other            in regards to the whole entire    stock            market, right? I&ll give my thoughts on            their numbers  Uh is there a huge run                    in regards to              ELF  Like really really really darn              good  Okay  Very happy shareholder  Now              that leads me to Nvidia big dog the                 stock that matters the most to the    stock              market out of any of the others  What&s              my op opinion on these earnings? What&s              my opinion on                      up after hours, but it&s not like it&s              up a lot  Like 4  move  It&s rather              modest, especially for a stock like                 Nvidia, right? So, which means people              are kind of like it&s it&s almost feels              a little bit more like a relief rally              than        there&s that&s going to be              part of the trade deal or something like              that you know then you talk about              meaningful upside to Nvidia stock for              the remainder of this year  Like let&s              say it&s 2 months in the future and we              get news come out US         AMD can start selling in              China  you know, boom, you&re gonna get              a banger a banger move up in Nvidia              stock  And so, and obviously AMD as              well  That would be massive, massive              news cuz all of a sudden you&re going to              be talking                      relationship, and it all ends up working              out in the end  We&ll see  But right              now, none of that&s priced into Nvidia              or AMD    stock  So, it&s just something to              keep in mind  And you know that that              would be very very bullish if if that              does happen        years  So do keep that in mind,              right? And so it just gets harder to              kind of make money in Nvidia stock,              right? And I even uh asked this on the              1000XX page today  I said    Nvidia or AMD              for the next 5 years  And my opinion is              AMD definitely should outperform        that starts in the second half of this              year where AMD growth rates at least in              my opinion based upon everything I&ve              you know Nvidia stock I&ve owned on and              off for years  So I know that company              very well and AMD obviously I&m a you              know now a        big shareholder of that              company  It&s now what the second              biggest stock in the public account               I believe that AMD is going to start              outgrowing    Nvidia revenue-wise in the              back half of this year  The back half of              this year, meaning the third

    the ride for the next 3 years in              regards to Amazon the third stock I              think will do the best out of these a              bunch this might come as a surprise to              some folks it&s    Nvidia it&s    Nvidia and              we&ll get into in just a moment why if I              feel        that confident about Nvidia why am              I buying AMD    stock right now rather than              buying    Nvidia right but when it comes to                 Nvidia you know a lot of it&s just        been              drisk now at this point in time you know              Nvidia is now trading at a forward P of        Street&s going to have a              lot of trouble with trying to figure out              nvidia&s 2026 growth rates and that&s              going to hurt the    stock substantially              for quite a while right and if you look              at    Nvidia stock it&s gone nowhere now              for 9 months or so right it&s because        no              one knows exactly or has any confidence              about where nvidia&s numbers are going              to be for 2026 are we talking a 10               Revenue Growth Company        doesn&t mean I&m bearish on them but              that leads us to why am I buying AMD              stock right now rather than Invidia if I              feel like confident well here&s              why    Nvidia has their Mi 350 coming out              very very soon here okay now what I              believe is going to        that now              additionally when you look at AMD versus              Nvidia you can be you could look at the              trailing 12mth p and think like oh AMD              looks like a ripoff    Nvidia looks like a              great deal okay no you don&t value a                 stock based upon trailing 12 Monon P you              value a        stock based upon forward p and              twoyear forward P because that&s what              really matters        from now we&ll be like              yeah he was right on like you know              didn&t mean a Nvidia was doomed it just              meant AMD was going to do a lot better              right for    stock I think is going to              perform the best out of these seven over              the next three years      
    by unusual whales but let&s             cover the one stock that&s made them way             more money than even that so back in             2022 the Pelos owned a bunch of shares             in the chip maker    Nvidia but they sold             those shares to avoid any appearance         November 2023 her husband bought              2 million worth of Nvidia options and             less than a month later the US announced             that    Nvidia could start selling chips to             China as long as they met certain             restrictions and uh    Nvidia stock went up             after that but Pelosi has defended her                   exercising that right the Pelosi sold             just over  2 million worth of Microsoft             recently and bought somewhere between 2             million and 10 million in additional             Nvidia        shares in two separate recent             trades so here&s why the Pelosi might be             buying more shares in Nvidia despite the                stock already being up over 2,000  in             the past 5 years and their        investments             from just last November being up over             200  in less than a year so Nvidia as a                stock has looked Unstoppable for the             last few years they make the chips             required for every new AI service that&s             being        to build on top of as             long as they&re using Nvidia gpus of             course like Mercedes self-driving             software or Tesla&s huge investments             into    Nvidia AI chips for their cars so             even though    nvidia&s    stock price is up             around 2600  over the past 5 years the                    get fined or their future business might             get limited which caused those investors             to Discount the stock but maybe Pelosi             thinks those risks are overblown now                Nvidia is already pretty well covered in             the media but we&ll see some much more             under the radar stocks       kna traded              274 million in that same period so kna             is an interesting case in that he&s             publicly advocated for a stock trading             ban on Congress despite himself             reportedly trading hundreds of millions             of dollars worth of stocks he actually             did a Reddit ask       eight purchases ranging between             15,000 to              250,000 per trade so let&s take a quick             look at Barkley&s Bank stock the    stock             has an average PE ratio for their             industry but their Price to Book value             and price to tangible Book value which                  
    the biggest company on Earth            there&s really only one question left to            ask is it finally time to sell Nvidia            stock or are its best days still to come            your time is valuable so let&s get right            into it first things first this video is                               without getting lucky I&ll talk about            the different reasons to sell a stock            whether it&s    Nvidia or otherwise I&ll            explain exactly who might consider            selling    Nvidia stock and why and of            course my latest long-term outlook on               Nvidia now that it&s the biggest company            on Earth but let me quickly        educational purposes only             all right let&s start with a few rules             to get rich without getting lucky so             that we can apply them to Nvidia stock             later in the video the first and most             important rule is this the first rule in             investment is don&t lose and the second             rule        rich you             know four or five will probably do it             over time Warren Buffett did not invest             in Nvidia he missed the boat on             Microsoft and he didn&t even buy Apple                stock which is his biggest position by             far until 2016 when Apple was already             worth over half a trillion dollars        business interactions             per year now uh what who are going to be             the winners in AI since this interview             tlio is down by 21  while Nvidia stock             is up by over 200  and just to be clear             none of this is Kathy Wood&s problem AR             invest manages a series of financial        shares             at least seven times so far and if             you&ve been watching this channel over             the last 3 years you&ve seen me buy             Nvidia stock over 40 separate times 40             the great thing about dollar cost             averaging is being able to buy more             shares for the same amount of money        of dollars             when I bought them that&s big enough to             thrive in this economy another reason to             sell a stock is that it&s simply             overvalued Believe It or Not    Nvidia is             still not overvalued you cannot judge             this company by price to earnings or             price to sales ratios that the        for the other stocks in your             portfolio but that begs the question why             sell Nvidia stock and the answer has             everything to do with the investor the             personal part of personal finance    Nvidia             grew way faster than every other    stock             on my list by a lot and it&s more than             10x in the      
    focused on             kind of not company specific things they             were focused on the markets in general             and like what&s going to happen with the             stock market that&s what&s going on with             individual stocks big big big difference             there right but meanwhile AMD announced             a big acquisition and this        all and so I&ve watched AMD do             some Acquisitions here recently and I             believe these Acquisitions are to             position them to compete directly with             Nvidia over this next 5 to 10 years if             not 15 to 20 years out right which I             think is very very brilliant in regards             to        then you think about amds             like that next lever up in my opinion of             that big opportunity woo I made a lot of             money on Nvidia stock obviously right I             don&t own any more shares I&ve sold on             my position completely not that I think             it&s going to be                    Acquisitions right they&re likely going             to continue to push uh in regards to             having the best chips in the world which             it seems like Nvidia will grab the title             of like the most impressive chip but             then AMD will come back and like they&ll             have a new chip and        it&s like who this             is even more impressive in this way and             this way and this way than Nvidia then                Nvidia will come back and so those two             are just going to go at it for years and             years and years uh but with that being        that are respected             now this Intel is Intel is just such a             mess that you don&t even have to worry             about Intel it&s Nvidia versus AMD and             that&s really it and you can&t really             come in and compete with these guys cuz             they have the best teams        they have the             best strategy right now and as long as             Jensen&s leading Nvidia and Lisa Sue is             leading AMD I don&t see any anybody             being able to come in and really compete             with these guys in any        in             regards to AMD is there a point where             I&m not interested in buying AMD shares             anymore I would say I would say if             Nvidia goes over 200 I&m good I&m good             if AMD goes over 200 I&m good if am AMD             if AMD goes to 175       the grocery story I              visit huge display obviously for Celsius              right there uh this one was quite              interesting Walmart Burlington Canada              does not even stock it so just show to              show you there&s still you know a              tremendous amount of opportunity for              Celsius International like is hardly              even expanded      
   delving deeper into the specific             investment opportunities in the AI space             and the first talk and question is             NVIDIA just to very quickly talk about             the performance of    Nvidia as a    stock let             me first talk about it and then I will             speak about whether it is a sensible                    move to consider something like Nvidia             at this juncture or not so first things             first let us look at the    stock journey             of    Nvidia over the last        few months so in             the last one month the stock has given             12 5 return almost in six        gone up by 170 percent in one             year almost like the same performance in             the last six months so last six months             have been crazy good for something like             Nvidia             then        comes the natural question that             okay is NVIDIA doing something out of             the world I try to read a lot about                Nvidia stock honestly I could not find             except for the hype that has been built                    around AI that Nvidia is providing             computational power to AI companies now             again please go back to that first half             of        the video that I was speaking about             that where does Nvidia fit it fits in             the hardware space that it is in very             simple words providing computational             ability to AI based companies if you                     processor the ability to hold that             intellectual property property now all             those are intangible benefits that             Nvidia will have going forward but to             cut the long story short the    stock has             already given a 170 run up so from that             perspective you are taking a fairly big                    happen that one is             that AMD kind of enough stay sideways or             it can rise and become something like             Nvidia in terms of    stock price or the                Nvidia stock can fall and come to AMD             levels now what story is going to play             out what story is not going       
    their most important           earnings call ever whether you&re a           longtime Nvidia shareholder or looking           to buy    Nvidia stock for the first time           you should know that this isn&t just           about revenues and profit margins              nvidia&s earnings decide the speed and            the scale of the entire AI Revolution so            in this video        I&ll break down everything            you need to know about nvidia&s latest            earnings        call and what it means for the            entire stock market your time is            valuable so let&s get right into it to            say this was one of the                    on with Blackwell they&re hugely             important Next Generation AI chip I&ll             talk about nvidia&s biggest risks right             now like their supply constraints and             their competition and of course what&s             in store for    Nvidia stock in the short             medium and long term there&s a lot to             talk about so        let&s Dive Right In to             nvidia&s most important earnings call                Nvidia posted record revenues of  30             billion for the quarter which is a                    earnings per share of 68 Which is             171  higher than a year ago after             accounting for their 10 for one stock             split things get even crazier when we             focus on    nvidia&s data center revenues             which now account for about 88  of their             total revenues today that&s why I&m not                    both of which also beat analyst EXP             expectations on top of that they issued             stronger than expected guidance for the             current quarter so why did Nvidia stock             drop 8  after such good earnings well             even though their 75 1  gross margins             are actually up 5 Points year-over-year             they&re down                    ecosystem has an issue that&s why I             spend so much time understanding             nvidia&s products not just their profits             and why I focus on the science behind             this    stock but credit where credit is             due look how fast    Nvidia was able to             address this issue with Blackwell and             how little it dropped      
   this you know let&s see what happens              over the next two quarters but look the              no reason for why Nvidia gained so much              like uh in in the    stock value after the              last quarter it certainly had nothing to              do with gaming yeah it was all about              they        said 11 billion in revenue for the              second quarter if you look at the first              quarter Revenue it&s just over seven              billion dollars and the Nvidia                      cut back and I want to be clear I talked              to someone at Nvidia like a a couple              weeks ago that said we cannot keep h100              in    stock and it will not be in    stock for              like this is where you know this person              was saying this is        I mean X is selling              very well though I think they&re doing              better yeah but very well to AMD and              very well to Nvidia are two completely              different things sadly              um              you know what probably talking that              thousands of units difference here we&re              not        once they&re there once they&re in              there and people are you know people              corporations are training their abusers              on on using like Nvidia Cuda qdnn              it&s very very difficult to shift shift              away from that I mean they are the              incumbent AMD needs something really                     on the AI              boom Intel yeah              I mean comparatively right it&s it&s a              complete like it&s funny how like Nvidia              stock price goes up I don&t know how              much it went up like what like 20 30              percent or more yeah and then        good              at ramming into ambulances yeah I mean              self-driving cars is a is a definite              tough one you&ll notice looking at              nvidia&s financials that their              Automotive Sales are really really going              nowhere like they&re stuck below 300              million a quarter so              it&       300              video you hinted that while chiplets              will let AMD throw more transistors at              HPC and AI problems that they are still              behind Nvidia and software at last              year&s financial analyst day Victor Pang              made an underreported announcement which              may have been the most important thing                    anyways but is it possible to create              most the most powerful machine learning              chips long term without chiplet              technology to me it seems like Nvidia              will still have to put a lot of energy              into chiplets soon or AMD can just brute              force their way into some market share      
   of Nvidia sank on Monday crashing           over the past two quarters here gaming           is expected to fall 33 year over year           and the number comes out it&s pretty           terrible the chip maker      year           and the number comes out it&s pretty           terrible the chip maker warned in            preliminary results that its second            quarter Revenue would drop by 19 the            stock is         rocketed It Up by more than 40            percent over the last few weeks but what            that really means is Nvidia stock is            priced for perfect execution and what            I&m about to show you is a threat to            every part of their business from         the power based on what each             specific application calls for from PC             processors and graphics cards to game             consoles and Tesla infotainment systems             Nvidia doesn&t really have anything like             that yet which is why their latest Ada             Lovelace cards are still monolithic             designs and not modular to        optimizing for             compute power per watt instead of             maximizing compute power at any cost             like Nvidia does today and now we&ve             come full circle at the start of the             episode I said that    Nvidia stock is             priced for perfect execution but amd&s             chiplet driven designs are posing a                    serious threat to their PC and data             center Solutions if we head over to             Simply Wall Street and look at their             fair value for NVIDIA which is based on                     discounted cash flow model we can see             that Nvidia is roughly fairly valued on             the other hand if we check out AMD we&ll             find that it&s about 40 percent             undervalued as I record this that             actually means the      roughly fairly valued on             the other hand if we check out AMD we&ll             find that it&s about 40 percent             undervalued as I record this that             actually means the stock would have to             go up by about 70        percent for simply             wall Street&s fair value price Target to             get reached and if we compare AMD and             nvidia&s forward price to earnings             ratios so using their next         64  while AMD trades at             about 37 7  this is what I meant in the             beginning of the video when I said that             Nvidia stock is priced based on perfect             execution except I just showed you that             they&re not executing perfectly at all             simply Wall Street is a        market share what             about further data center Solutions I&m             excited to hear your thoughts as for me             I do think that Nvidia stock is in some             serious trouble and I&d want to see             their price their earnings ratio fall             more in line with their peers       
    the company            forecasting stronger than expected sales            some of the biggest customers of this            company are Nvidia Intel and AMD            something crazy is happening at Super            Micro computer and smci    stock has more            than tripled in the last month alone and            whenever I see that kind of growth         which is             right up there with the kind of growth             that Nvidia reported in their most             recent quarter I&ve been buying    Nvidia             stock since it was well below  200 per             share and 400 and 600 but    Nvidia is not             the only company growing fast in this             massive AI        boom Lambda Labs provides             other companies with infrastructure for             deep learning everything from clusters             of nvidia&s h200 gpus         for specific workloads this building             block architecture is what lets smci             move so fast in so many different             verticals when a company like Nvidia             launches a new chip super micro doesn&t             need to design a whole new server system             for it they just need to design       of             course as this ecosystem keeps growing             it makes more sense for more data             centers to support it smci has building             blocks for nvidia&s Hopper gpus amd&s             epic chips Intel Sapphire Rapids and             many more that means super micro can             design build test optimize and         accelerators and amd&s mi200 and             Mi 250 systems and I expect that demand             to continue with their next generation             of modules for nvidia&s upcoming h200             and B100 Blackwell chips their Grace             Hopper Super Chips as well as the next             generation of amd&s instinct and        of             the way let&s talk about the right price             for smci stock super micro is a great             way to gain exposure to the data center             Hardware market during this AI boom             every time    Nvidia AMD or Intel come out             with a new chip super micro designs and         I don&t think it&s             too late to buy smci stock I would             average in over time especially if we             see more days where the    stock drops by             20  or more I&ve been holding    Nvidia             stock since 2016 and I know I&d             seriously regret it if        I stopped             building my position after the stock had             tripled I think the same will be true                   
    off on kind of what they&re             expected for capex now you could look at             that as a positive for Guess Who             companies like Nvidia companies like AMD             right who do you think is going to reap             the most benefit of all that capex             additional spending from Google it       &s             going to be compy it would certainly be             Nvidia number one and then number two             would think about as somebody like an             AMD right so that&s huge but people             don&t like        big companies right all the             big companies are utilizing AMD             sometimes there could be this false             assumption that you know if Microsoft&s             using Nvidia like they&re not going to             use AMD no that&s not the way it works             same thing vice versa they need all             these companies        they need Nvidia chips             they need AMD chips sometimes they&re             for different use cases sometimes it&s             similar sometimes it&s more like who can                                  okay they&re in the Penalty Box and I&m              not just talking about AMD I&m talking              about Nvidia as well    Nvidia stock has              fallen 21  in the past month has    Nvidia              come out with earnings in the past month              no have they reported some disappointing              article news no the only         at alltime highs you know all              those sorts of things and it&s a true              fear but it&s a big bigger fear for              NVIDIA than it is AMD cuz AMD is the              much smaller player here so they&re the              one that and also they&re the ones that       versus this year              and meta that&s fine as well I&m not              losing sleepover at all I would a little              bit if I was Nvidia shareholder because              that&s a little you know we&re talking              about a different valuation there on              that company right and obviously people                     got so accustomed to these unbelievable              growth rates in Nvidia but as an AMD              shareholder I look at this deep sea              stuff and I&m like whatever I&m not              losing sleep over this I        spend on like that              would be awesome it&s not realistic              they&re going to have to spend year in              and year out with Nvidia with AMD with              these companies because guess what they              keep coming out with better chips and              let&s say you&re you&re Google

    are pretty            tenured in fact the average manager at            Nvidia has been there for 15 years even            if we assumed that they had an            entry-level software engineering job the            entire time they would have earned about             24,000 per      there for 15 years even            if we assumed that they had an            entry-level software engineering job the            entire time they would have earned about             24,000 per year in stock we can even            assume that it was only 10                   15,00 ,000 per year over 15 years that            adds up to             225,000 worth of stock not a bad amount            itself but wait until we account for               stock growth over the past 10 years               Nvidia stock has grown 200x so even if            this employee only held on to less than            half of their        stock rent over the years            or about 100,000 with a 200x return they            would now have  20        million worth of just            Nvidia stock and that&s being            conservative if they got a few            promotions and held on        to more of their            stock Rand they would be closer to 30 to            50 million and those that were able to                    with on a daily basis is just a stacked             if not far more stacked in fact I bet             there&s a lot of Nvidia Engineers who             sold more    stock than they needed to for             one reason or another and they probably             get made fun of by their friends for             throwing away a        that take             Dell for example the company ipoed in             1988 and over the next 12 years the             stock would run up a staggering             1200X for a perspective that&s six times             more than even    Nvidia over the past 10             years naturally this created a lot of             millionaires 27 00 to be precise        this sort of mentality             trickles down the entire company and             this is why you don&t see Nvidia             millionaires buying supercars and mega             mansions usually they&re just             liquidating small portions of their                stock brand to pay off their existing             house and build up larger cash reserves             it&s almost as if

    business and AI  That&s             their main growth engine  That&s where             the big money is coming from  This is             why almost everybody is buying Nvidia             stock, this thing right here  But they             still have three other business lines             which are there, which are making money              We&ve got gaming  They&re               well  We&ve got professional             visualization, architecture, medical             design, 3D imaging, and of course,             automotive and edge computing, basically             Nvidia self-driving tech  Now, nobody&s             buying    Nvidia stock because of their             self-driving tech  Nobody&s buying it             because of the gaming stuff  People are             buying because of this thing         This thing             is the big bet  This is where Nvidia&s             value is coming from  This is the same             thing why people buy        a very interesting             development once earnings come in but             again it&s dependent on what Nvidia will             show and what Jensen will say everything             hinges on that and I&ll explain what I             mean so the    stock price reaction             following the earnings it can literally             be the opposite of anything you think                    intuitively the reports might be good              and the stock might come down the              reports might be bad and the    stock can              come up Anything can happen short-term              in the    stock price  I wouldn&t get too              obsessed about what&s happening with the                 Nvidia price in the 24 hours right after              the earnings                      Okay  Now, what do I mean by that?              I&ll show you  This is the video that I              posted on December 23rd, 2021 about              Nvidia  Nvidia, the ultimate    stock  This              is the headline  I don&t know if you              guys can see it  I&m going to highlight              it in green so you        see what I mean               Nvidia, the ultimate    stock right here               Okay, December 23rd, 2021  Okay, I don&t              think I&ve been wrong about this, right?              Since this video came out        is 4x  So, ever              since that video was made, if you&re              watching my channel, I mean, you&ve seen              Nvidia do forex since I said it was the              ultimate    stock  But if you break it down              to short-term, you&re going to see that              it wasn&t that sweet the      
    continue to invest all the gains             like you&ll start to hit your first             first run around a 10e period if you             look at Nvidia which is now the number             one uh return             company um in this sector the everyone             put in chat for the last 22 years what                    has been a return of Nvidia but if you             missed out these last five years you             would have missed out on probably 10 or             15,000 per gains you         you have to find a way to do              right by your audience customer base              client base while maximizing profit and              this is why Nvidia Apple meta they are              hitting record high because they found a              enough of a balance to do that but for              he Healthcare companies       there is you&re walking by              yourself so I mean security detail              especially in that position because              you&re right when a company like Nvidia              might have a delay on Blackwell it&s              like all right that&s a tech inue right              or apple has a delay on         good I&m replacing Apple out of              two te 2 index so you can see that I              stand on this business but Apple              Microsoft Nvidia vo vti are the five to              invest in if if you want a another              company Eli              Lily Superstar rockar company great              leadership great        these company CEOs and you know              that&s how you know Nvidia went up and              all of those people that became              millionaires because they were employees              from    Nvidia that because they had    Nvidia              stock not because they Diversified              because they had    Nvidia stock and the              same thing happened with apple and the              same       t know how              the other ones are going to pan out like              I know what the multiple for Apple              should be by 2040 and Nvidia and              Microsoft and Vanguard and black rock              took over crypto so that&s expanded              their portfolio so I think too often              times         say              the right diversification right because              if we if we&re talking about like the              guys you mentioned              Zuckerberg has stock the employee has in                 Nvidia but he&s Diversified in companies              right so like yes all his nest a wasn&t              in apple but Apple&s his         out you know what I mean but              holding the asset for it like imagine if              Kathy would have just held              Bitcoin and Tesla and Nvidia from 2018              what shout out to Kathy              s what              conviction sounds like when you actually              do your       
   and these Mi350              versus Blackwell chips and whatnot,              right? And people are going to keep              comparing them  Well, what about the              MI400 versus whatever Nvidia&s, you              know, best chips are at that particular              time, right? And then they&re going to              be talking about the CUDA software and              they        the day, you got to              understand Nvidia&s a  3 3 trillion              market cap  AMD does not have to destroy                 Nvidia to to have the    stock perform              tremendous over the next few years,              right?    Nvidia, in my opinion, and this              is coming from somebody that has owned                 Nvidia stock in the past and made              tremendous gains        on this stock  Okay? I              don&t own any    Nvidia now at this point              in time         not this bad company, not that              AMD is going to destroy              Nvidia simply because a    Nvidia is about              to move into starting in the       won&t even              be remotely close in my opinion to where              a Nvidia is right now  And that does not              mean AMD&s bad or    Nvidia is bad or              anything like that  just means like you              got to understand each    stock is its own              case and there&s just immense upside              ahead for       here, right? Like the fact              that they&re going to grow so immensely              in my opinion over this next four or              five years and they&ll still be way              under Nvidia&s revenue and        net income              now  Imagine if they could get their net              income margins anywhere close to Nvidia               Could you imagine what invid what AMD                 stock price we could be talking about a              10, you know, 10x        stock if that&s the              situation? Maybe not a thousandx    stock,              but a 10x    stock  Right now, keep in              mind, we haven&t even       
              everything I&ll cover in this video            amd&s latest earnings their next            Generation Instinct gpus the biggest            risks for AMD stock like competing with               Nvidia and of course where all of this            puts AMD on my list of stocks to get            rich without getting lucky in 2024 which       data center             revenues which is up a whopping             122  year-over-year that sounds great at             first but let&s compare that to Nvidia             nvidia&s data center revenues clocked in             at  26 3 billion last quarter which was             up by and insane             154  year-over-year and        Advance all of the infrastructure all of             the logistics and the amount of             technology and equipment that came in on             that day Nidia nvidia&s infrastructure             and Computing infrastructure and all             that technology to training 19             days just you know you don&t want did             anybody sleep                   are benefiting from this AI boom said             another way for every dollar I put into             Nvidia stock 88 cents are directly             exposed to AI but for every dollar I put             into AMD    stock it&s more like 25 to 35             cents that&s a big difference in terms             of       seriously ramping up hopper and             Blackwell production as well as coming             out with ethernet-based networking             Solutions in fact 3 7 billion of             nvidia&s Revenue came from AI networking             products last quarter which is still             more than all of amd&s data center             revenues today now        units account for almost 50  of             amd&s Revenue remember for every dollar             I put into Nvidia stock 88 cents are             directly exposed to AI but for every             dollar I put into AMD    stock it&s more             like 25 to 35 that leads me to the third             risk for AMD       I&m not saying that x86 is             going away anytime soon but most major             chip designers are leveraging the arm             architecture more and more nvidia&s             grace CPU is arm-based so are Google&s             tensor processing units and Microsoft&s             Cobalt chips and aws&s graviton                     amd&s latest earnings their             Data Center gpus and the risks of             competing with Nvidia while being spread             across many different verticals let&s             talk about what that all means for AMD                stock and if you feel I&ve earned it             consider hitting the like button and                    and growing faster             once I realize that I can get around             three times more direct AI exposure for             every dollar I spend on Nvidia stock             than I do from AMD it really changed the             way I value both companies and this is             why it&s so important to      
               going to continue to increase            exponentially and CPU performance            scaling will never return there is a            better way this is Jensen hang nvidia&s            founder he saw the problem but also the            opportunity video games were            simultaneously one of the most            computationally challenging problems and              enthusiasts were also moving away in a             different direction towards more             powerful dedicated gaming PCs this             Market was growing exponentially and             Nvidia found an Ever growing Market             selling directly to Consumers but then             things went into overdrive their             Flagship GPU the GTX 1080 TI in        so why did GPU Skyrocket in price             well it turns out that video games are             only one part of the story in total             Nvidia stock has grown by over             300,000 to over  3 trillion and looking             closer most of that growth happened in             the last 7        Cisco did             end up Surviving the slaughter but to             this day 24 years later Cisco stock has             yet to recover to their Doom Peak so             what does this have to do with    Nvidia             just because one company crashed doesn&t             mean that another will well let&s         like             AT&amp;T and Intel have P ratios of 10 to be             blunt Nvidia is a house of cards their                stock price is way overvalued for their             revenue and earnings since late 2022                nvidia&s Revenue has overd doubled but             their valuation has 13x largely due to                    speculation and perceived value as             opposed to             fundamentals and the reality is that             Nvidia will have an extremely        similar to Cisco in 2000 and I&m not the             only one who&s noticed Jensen hang             himself is anxious about Nvidia             following the same path    nvidia&s    stock             has gotten far ahead of itself it&s             become fragile overvalued and doesn&t             reflect the company&s revenue or        profits             and as such I think Nvidia has reached             its peak or is very very close to it             last time I made        in better             hands but here&s the thing even with a             70  crash Nvidia would be worth an             astonishing  1 trillion so this isn&t             anti-    Nvidia it&s just anti- their    stock             price so let&s see what happens let me             know in the comments if      
   the beginning of the firm so every            stock in our portfolio has been analyzed            with that lens on and to give you the            best example of this       in our portfolio has been analyzed            with that lens on and to give you the            best example of this Nvidia 2014 we            owned    Nvidia we were exposed to    Nvidia            Nvidia at that time was a five dollar               stock and now it is a four hundred                   dollar stock five dollars and somewhere            in the five to ten billion dollars now         AI is a big idea so             this is a big reason that I track Arc             invest research and their Investments             they were buying Nvidia stock back in             2014 and they were one of the first             research firms to realize that gpus             would be useful way more than just         for example before Tesla made             their own self-driving chips they used             nvidia&s gpus and for years these kinds             of applications weren&t priced into                nvidia&s    stock and dark invests spent             those years buying the    stock for pennies             on the dollar but they didn&t keep this             information        went up because her funds             grew overall that&s not the same thing             as her buying a specific stock hand over             fist like she did with    Nvidia five years             ago so this combined AUM number gives us             a good Baseline to compare individual             positions against so here&s       to have             happened with some of their biggest             positions like Shopify exact sciences             and of course Nvidia Kathy Wood has been             catching a lot of heat for selling out             of    Nvidia stock right before it tripled             in price especially since she&s been             such a big investor in them        since 2014             and realized that they were such a great             AI stock years before most of the market             but instead of         trillion dollar             companies thanks to their app stores and             mobile software ecosystems today we&re             going through the same kind of pattern             Nvidia is the hardware company capturing             a lot of value on the hardware side as             we transition from CPUs to gpus or from             calculation        top of those new devices and the new             chips that power them okay so far invest             knows this and they&re already selling             Nvidia stock what the heck are they             buying to answer that let&s turn to             another Quick Clip that I&ve edited down             to just       
   highs in your            portfolios absolutely incredible this            bull runs just marching on I signed up            yesterday six six people in the private            stock group have hit seven figures in            the past week six people like absolutely            incredible right another eight people            hit six figures plus of       don&t think I am Nvidia look at             this    Nvidia falls into correction             territory down 10  from its record close             folks I show you this cuz this shows you             how fast sentiment can shift in the             market okay      from its record close             folks I show you this cuz this shows you             how fast sentiment can shift in the             market okay right everybody in their             Grandma wanted Nvidia stock 6 months ago                    going into this year going into last             year like everybody wanted Nvidia like             it was the play before it was paler and             Tesla it was    Nvidia right everybody              wanted    Nvidia and look at this Su stocks              now        in correction territory while the              nasdaq&s blasting off to all-time highs              who could ever thought that and did              Nvidia magically report bad numbers no                 nvidia&s last numbers were great when              they reported last month the guidance              was phenomenal the conference call was              phenomenal there       it&s              absolutely fascinating how that works so              you got Bitcoin at all-time highs NASDAQ              all-time highs and we got Nvidia that&s              just like doing what like like in              correction territory that&s insane right              now I don&t know how many        you              know this will play out again in Tesla              this will play out again in              pener this will play out again in Nvidia              like it&s just one big game of going              through this roller coaster ride of              emotions right and you usually know                     down              20 30 40  50  whatever the way you get              through those markets right is you got              to be Diversified across growth stock              value stocks dividend stocks and you&ve              got to own plenty of companies that are              very high quality high quality means              they       last two years look at Monster stock the              last two years those haven&t been the              play people haven&t want to be an energy              drink companies the last couple years no              no no no no no they want           last two years those haven&t been the              play people haven&t want to be an energy              drink companies the last couple years no              no no no no no they want to be in Nvidia              last two years right         an extraordinary how well so many              of those dividend and value stocks held              up in 2022 what text stocks are just              getting obliterated Nvidia meta go              through the whole list they all got              wrecked right AMD Netflix Shopify the              whole list of them they&re all down      
    stock price increases you will lose              money so we&ll look at an example of              that right now and for this example              we&re gonna look at a put option trade              in Invidia      gonna look at a put option trade              in Invidia and obviously this trades              gonna lose money because who is buying              puts in invidia who is betting against              Nvidia                    did end up surging higher and therefore              the put options price collapsed and in              the most recent date on this chart we              can see that Nvidia stock price was at              around three hundred and twenty one              dollars over  40 00 higher than the put              options strike price of two hundred and                      meaning that it              was essentially worthless so if a trader              bought this put option for               700 and they held it until the              expiration when NVIDIA was three hundred              and twenty dollars or higher they would              have lost the entire  1100 premium that              they paid for this put option because                     a              put option you would have much less risk              buying a put option compared to shorting              100 shares of stock so in this    Nvidia              example if I shorted a hundred shares of                 stock at 280 dollars per share and the              share price went to 320 I would have a              loss of  4,        option              that has a further expiration date will              be trading with significantly more              extrinsic value because there&s lots              more time left for the stock price to              move and therefore cause the option to              become significantly more valuable              particularly intrinsically valuable now              the IWM put that we looked                   intelidox shares has been significantly              higher on every single trading day as              compared to visa shares for example on              May 14th the high to low stock price              range in visa meaning the highest price              of the shares subtracting the lowest              price of the shares on that trading day              was somewhere                              will make money from a decrease or              shrinking in the valuations of those              options and you can do so without any              change in the stock price or without any              passage of time because implied              volatility changing literally means that              the option prices are changing and              really important changes      profit on this is currently 33 hundred              dollars in 16 days that was 16 days ago              so this option has almost doubled in              price because NVIDIA has been screaming              higher and I own this call option so              this is a big increase in the options              price and this is a little      
    week nvidia&s Market hit a trillion           dollar valuation they joined that           elusive trillionaire club with apple           Microsoft Google and Amazon they&ve come           back a little bit but they&re      Microsoft Google and Amazon they&ve come           back a little bit but they&re still            right up there with the five companies            that are responsible for 96 of the            entire stock market&s       500 stocks in the s p            5500 there are really only five stocks            that matter the 495 other stocks            combined have essentially returned zero            and we all know why Nvidia         right now we&ve uh we&ve seen the very            early days of what could surely turn            into an AI bubble but Nvidia can&t be            the only    stock out there right they have            to have some competition some other            companies that are going to make the            backbone of this         today            on Don money we found them and we&re            going to tell you what and how we&re            investing in the next Nvidia yeah               stock this is dumb money live            hey there Dave here along with Chris and            Jordan we are done money welcome to dumb            money live         coolest thing I&ve ever seen and the one             thing that all of these things have in             common is that the running on Nvidia             gpus so it&s no surprise that    Nvidia             stock is up to 100 this year uh and our             goal here to uh today is to identify the             next        Nvidia and I know you guys have                stock picks so let&s get right into it             yeah Dave there&s something else that             all of        these             um companies that are adopting AI have             in common             besides just utilizing nvidia&s gpus             most if not all       have very different servers right             they have uh very different high-speed             Network architecture everything about             the next-gen data center is different so             Nvidia             is kind of the most obvious piece of             that new gen data center but certainly             not the only piece and I think that the                    &s              right              um and Taiwan City is just sitting at a              comfortable like 15 p e              um and they produce everything that              Nvidia designs so    Nvidia is just a uh              they&re just an IP company yeah              and software but um TSM actually              produces these things great great PE                    
    doubled this year or more but            and this is a big one that Marquee            arcfont missed out on that jaw-dropping            rally in Nvidia which she exited            entirely in early January in that            Flagship fund let&s get an inside look            joining us now is kathywood herself        yeah so we started our research on            artificial intelligence actually when we            were studying the possibility of            autonomous vehicles way back in 2014            Nvidia at the time was five dollars            that&s on the split basis five dollars            now it&s closing in on 450 so we wrote        way more than the other             stocks that she&s been selling out of so             it&s clear that Kathy Wood is using             Nvidia stock as more of a cash position             now and selling it to buy other stocks             that she feels are undervalued but what             stocks       our             portfolio the companies have proprietary             data that no one else has             so Kathy is this as good as it gets for             NVIDIA or are you looking for an             opportunity to pick back up some shares             sure if it were to correct it goes             through these       revenue and videos focused on hardware             for every dollar of Hardware AI will             pull through probably eight dollars of             software so again Nvidia really             important Cornerstone    stock has from             five dollars to four hundred and fifty             dollars done a lot of work and now             people understand it&s         on these are the same kind of stocks             that Kathy Wood has been buying with her             profits from Nvidia stock alright but             now that we can see just how much    Nvidia             stock has skyrocketed over the last few             months I think it&s fair to ask whether             Kathy would regret       Deirdre up front actually not             actually not you know what we moved into             more Tesla more coinbase those are up as             much as Nvidia so we&re I&m a portfolio             manager we&re managing a portfolio and             when we see one valuation Skyrocket and             other valuations        research their stock picks and even the             timing of some of their traits but one             thing we should never be doing as             investors is dismissing it when somebody             makes a boatload of      we should never be doing as             investors is dismissing it when somebody             makes a boatload of money and that&s             exactly what Kathy Wood has been doing             with Nvidia stock and coinbase    stock             before        that and Tesla stock before that             we should always be making data-driven             decisions and the best part is Arc             invest publishes their research       
    the key           to finding great stocks is understanding           a company&s products not just their           profits and I&m convinced that Nvidia            will be bigger than Apple bigger than            Microsoft and    Nvidia stock will sit on            top of the indexes as the biggest            company on Earth let me show you why            your time        things that            investors need to know about Blackwell&s            design costs and margins the networking            technologies that Nvidia built to scale            Blackwell data centers to mindboggling            sizes and of course whether I&m buying               Nvidia stock as a result and where I&d            put it on the list that I made at the                   start of the year to get rich without            getting lucky but let me point out a few            quick things before I dive into nvidia&s            insane new Blackwell gpus        to             wait 10 years to find the next iPhone or             hold the next Apple stock that&s why I&m             making these videos now all right one             last point and then I&ll dive right into                nvidia&s Hardware I get asked all the             time how I make these videos and I                    Blackwell data centers to do anything             Humanity can throw at it now with all of             that context let&s talk about whether I             would buy Nvidia stock at today&s prices             and if you feel I&ve earned it consider             hitting the like button and subscribing             to the channel that really helps        out more deep             Dives like this thanks and with that out             of the way let&s talk about Nvidia stock             I think that Blackwell is about to move             the needle in a big way for    NVIDIA black             Blackwell is not just a new data center             GPU it&s an entire compute platform             chips                    self-driving Cars Smart factories and             even humanoid robots all of which I&ll              cover over the next few videos because I              really believe that Nvidia stock will              sit at the top of the indexes and              Pension funds and everyone&s portfolios              for years to come so with everything              I&ve learned         900              per share I also ended up moving Amazon              stock up one spot since AWS is the              biggest cloud service provider on the              planet and I think that their Bedrock              platform for generative AI is about to              benefit      since AWS is the              biggest cloud service provider on the              planet and I think that their Bedrock              platform for generative AI is about to              benefit a lot from nvidia&s Blackwell              gpus this is why it&s so important

   flip my flapjacks a little bit and uh           made  11,500 plus dollars on Nvidia           stock in the public account  And then           through my other portfolios as well,           ended up making multi5 figures on    Nvidia           stock last year  But    Nvidia was really            just the appetizer  We&re about to get            into the main        course  I&m going to make            multi6 figures on AMD stock and I            believe it&s going to be a tremendous                    Now, that can             compete against Intel in some ways  In             in other ways, it&s going to be             competing much more heavily against             Nvidia over the coming years  Okay? And             when you think about data center             business, think about all these massive             companies that are spending all this         systems which is basically going to help             position the company in a much better             competitive um let&s call it framework             to go against Nvidia over this next 10             to 20 years  Now, did you hear what I             just said there? 10 to 20 years  People             think this       of almost             anybody  Like you look at all the big             tech companies, none of them are even             remotely close to that number other than             Nvidia  And that&s it  And that&s it,             right? That&s an incredible number given             the environment we&re in  And keep in                                non-GAAP basis              Phenomenal data center  This is where             all the focus really is because this is             the big growth engine for Nvidia  Like                Nvidia&s other segments of their             business are going to be growing over             the next number of years, right? But             this is the big        for              every  1 they put in Nvidia or something              like that or do half and half  Like              there&s a lot of different options here,              right? But to, you know, sit on your              hands and and not be      that or do half and half  Like              there&s a lot of different options here,              right? But to, you know, sit on your              hands and and not be interested in this              stock is just, it&s kind of crazy       , man               It&s kind of crazy  And so, um, you              know, the futures are looking very good              for both those companies long term in my              opinion  AMD and Nvidia  I just think              there&s based        spend at least as much as they              thought they were going to spend, if not              more  Doesn&t take a genius to figure              out Nvidia is going to come through with              great numbers  I just watched Jensen              today on CNBC  He looked as confident as              ever  So, what      
    engineering just is a giant mess and              trickery so as I understand they went              below Cuda so they go super low              programming of gpus effectively Nvidia              builds this Library called nickel right              uh in which you know when you&re              training a model you have all these              communications between every single       and they would              flip back and forth between them and              this requires extremely low-level              programming this is what nickel does              automatically or other Nvidia libraries              handle this automatically usually yeah              exactly and so so technically they&re              using you know PTX which is like sort of              like you        Etc but              they have a lot of computer can you in              general actually just zoom out and also              talk about the the hopper architecture              the Nvidia Hopper GPU architecture and              the difference between h100 and h800              like you mentioned the interconnects              yeah so there&s you know Amper was the                     might subsidize them and              therefore if AI takes a long time to              become differentiated we&ve knapped the              financial performance of American              companies Nvidia can sell less tsmc              cannot sell to China so therefore we              have less demand to therefore in to like              keep driving the production cycle so        to              design any chips I&m just going to              contra manufacturer chips for else other              people um and one of their early              customers is NVIDIA right    Nvidia was is              is the only Semiconductor Company uh              that&s worth you know that&s doing more              than a billion dollars of Revenue that                    it possible since they&re a hedge              fund that they timed everything with              this release and the pricing and and              they have they shorted in Nvidia stock              and    stock of USA              companies and released it with star like              just perfect timing to be able to make              money like they&ve released it on       and cheaper and               cheaper the the big deep seek R1 release               freaked everybody out because of the               cheaper one of the manifestations of               that is Nvidia stock plummeted uh can               you explain what happened I mean and               also just explain this moment and               whether you know if        a straight line               up right and and there&s been so many               different narratives that have been               trying to push down Nvidia not I don&t               say push down    Nvidia stock everyone is               looking for a reason to sell or to be               worried right um you know it was it&s it                     
    training and inference but             it&s important to understand that smci             does not make their own chips instead             they take chips from companies like             Nvidia AMD and Intel and integrate them             into their own data center             infrastructure adding Power Electronics             cooling networking Solutions and             software depending       the mind-blowing speed of             standing up this super cluster was only             possible because Elon Musk used super             micro&s liquid cooling modules for             nvidia&s H1 100 gpus Elon is also             deploying super micro Solutions at             massive scales in supercomputers over at             Tesla which are used to train Tesla       centers onto             their Hardware ecosystem while they             still have a massive performance             advantage over their competitors that&s             why it currently appears that Nvidia is             routing orders away from Super Micro and             to their other partners which also seems             to be backed up by Charles leang saying             that       that they&re not receiving             enough Nvidia chips to fulfill their             backlog of orders so even if super micro             does regain compliance and stays listed             on the NASDAQ which isn&t guaranteed             this whole      regain compliance and stays listed             on the NASDAQ which isn&t guaranteed             this whole situ ation could further             erode institutional confidence in             Holding smci stock and that means lower             trading        volume less access to Capital             and increased borrowing costs on top of             that Nvidia can keep rerouting orders             until they&re sure that super micro             fixed all of their         on the flip             side my guess is that this will impact             nvidia&s overall sales and earnings and             we may seen some short-term pain since             expectations for    nvidia&s performance             are always so high but even if    Nvidia             stock does drop my stance is the same             today as it&s been        for the last 3 years             Nvidia is the most powerful AI company             on Earth with the best        management team             on Earth and the stock will perform             accordingly over time    nvidia&s next             earnings call      
   usually less than 20  and a             crash is a decline of 20  or more so for             example the NASDAQ is currently in a             correction while Nvidia stock is             crashing all right here&s a chart of             every Bull and Bear Market since 1956             with the recessions Shaded in Gray on             this         that&s a 32  compound annual growth rate             for 25 years straight absolutely             crushing the returns of the S&amp;P 500 and             remember even though Nvidia stock is             down by 20  over the last month it&s             still trading at over  100 per share so             your  10,000 from 1999 would actually        be             worth around  12 million today if you             could have held it that long I&ve been             holding Nvidia stock for over 8 years             and it&s been one of the most difficult             things I&ve ever done here&s another             version of       took to             recover before making a new high said             another way this chart shows every dip             correction and crack that Nvidia has             ever had so let&s count them up    Nvidia             stock has corrected by 10  or more 31             separate times that&s once every 10             months on average it&s crashed        by 20  or             more 18 separate times not including             this one that means Nvidia stock has a             full-on crash every 17 months on average             it&s crashed by over 30  11 of those             times which means it had        85  over the next year and 2 years later             you were still down by by 80  it took             Nvidia over 5 years to recover just in             time for the global financial crisis             where    Nvidia stock fell over 80  again             except this time instead of recovering             after 5 years it was still down by                    around 70  it ended up taking 9 years             for Nvidia stock to make a new high nine             years my point is these two price charts             are actually the same chart which means             investors can&t get       because             they have quarterly numbers that they             need to hit but don&t forget volatility             swings both ways just last week on July             31st 2024 Nvidia stock had its single             Best Day Ever it added a whopping             3029 billion in value going up 133  in             one day as a  3 trillion         me and I showed you             historical data on the depth and length             of Corrections and crashes for the S&amp;P             500 as well as Nvidia stock now that             we&re on the same page about the context             let me tell you what I&m doing now that             everyone seems to       
  Jensen hang just delivered a crazy           keynote at computex and I&m convinced           that Wall Street does not understand           Nvidia Nvidia is now bigger than Apple           and the    stock has more than tripled over           the last year alone so it&s easy to            assume that this has to be        the top but            the key to finding great stocks is            understanding a company&s products not            just their profits and after this            keynote I&m convinced that Nvidia                   2026 I&ll break down nvidia&s inference            microservices or Nims for AI model            deployment and then I&ll cover    Nvidia            Omniverse their platform for digital            Twins and simulations at massive scales            and of course what all of this means for                             Omniverse their platform for digital            Twins and simulations at massive scales            and of course what all of this means for            Nvidia stock as a result but let me                   point out a few quick things before I            dive into nvidia&s brand new gpus first               Nvidia is not just a hardware company            they&re an endtoend AI Computing                               chip switches like NV link and rack Tock            networking Solutions like infiniband or            Spectrum X that&s the bottom layer of            nvidia&s Stack    nvidia&s Cuda ecosystem            and acceleration libraries sit on top of            that at a high level this part of the            stack enables accelerated        individual Nims as building blocks as             well but there&s one more software             platform in particular that you should             know about and that&s nvidia&s Omniverse             no not the metaverse people actually             like this one Omniverse is a 3D             simulation platform that lets artists             designers engineers and       processing and             artificial intelligence which can be             broken down into different acceleration             libraries software packages and now Nims              that are powered by nvidia&s CPUs gpus              and networking Solutions that&s how              everything fits together and why              upgrades and Innovations in any one part              of the                    this thanks and with that out of the way              let&s talk about nvidia&s    stock at the              time of this recording    Nvidia has a              bigger market cap than Apple and I              personally believe that    Nvidia will be              bigger than Microsoft by the end of the              year for all        of that going to              software not just Hardware so for me              this is a long-term investment I&ve been              buying Nvidia stock well before the              split and I&ll be buying it long after              the split as well and if the      
   riskier but still very solid bet on the             future of AI okay now for stock number             four I&m gonna go with another    stock             here that I consider to be relatively             medium risk and that&s going to be                Nvidia ticker symbol nvda who unlike the             other companies that we&ve talked about                    so far Nvidia is much more focused on             the processing power that will be needed                    for AI as well as some of the software             infrastructure too but on the hardware             side Nvidia develops the world&s highest             performance graphical processing chips             otherwise known as gpus that can process             giant amounts of data at extremely fast             speeds      more than 70             percent of the fastest super computers             on Earth too and like I said it&s not             just on the hard Hardware site Nvidia             also has some of the best AI software in             the world including an autonomous             driving platform that is already used by             nearly 400 different       Logistics Public Safety sanitation             transportation and a lot more much of             that is actually video being collected             and processed which is the specialty of             Nvidia gpus there&s also their Omniverse             platform that not only helps companies             integrate into the metaverse but it also             takes real world environments and             transforms       biggest forms of             entertainment in the metaverse OR             cryptocurrencies which will likely be             one of the most used forms of currency             as well well Nvidia they their chips are             always being used for both high             performance gaming as well as             cryptocurrency mining all of these             various markets have so        much future your             potential that Nvidia estimates that             their total addressable Market will be             worth over a trillion dollars yet             they&re only doing about 27 billion in             sales for the       2022 fiscal year so that&s             like 27 times larger of a growth             opportunity and yet because of the             current economy and market conditions             Nvidia stock has experienced a             Monumental crash this past year losing             more than half of its entire value long             term though I still think it&ll be      
    you            can at least develop a perspective and            also a very quick note that if you have            been noticing in the stock market then            companies like    Nvidia have grown            massively in the last few months which            shows that these corporate companies are            making a lot of money on        is what is being said that             Chinese have kind of reverse engineered             the whole thing             and as a result what happened was that             Nvidia right which is what which does             what well it supplies computing power to             both openi and hopefully in the future             we Supply it to       20 21  in             the last 2 days so then comes the             natural question that okay computing             power has improved then why did the             Nvidia stock fall so this is a note that             I had written on the member community so             in case you are interested I had             explained it        quite extensively on my             member Community wrote multiple             post I mean it will give you more             clarity so Nvidia used to supply certain             kind of more expensive chips which             typically used to cost  35,000 plus each             now due to the advancement in       being led by Deep seek the AI can be             trained on much cheaper chips now you             will come naturally then should we             invest in Nvidia right now or not see             this is a guess work because multiple             stories can be built here the positive             story is that see        this is like overall             advancement in AI a lot of local             startups will come they will also seek             support from companies like Nvidia there             will be more demand of chips because             they will try to build the next version             of Deep Sea story to is that        a lot of             structures right or the next leg of             experiments that they were running for             developing commercial applications of AI             based on Nvidia Hardware structures now             the assessment is yeah maybe we don&t             they don&t require this Hardware             structure anymore so this was a                     opportunity number three you have to bet             on Innovation right it&s fine right I             mean if you are considering to wait on             Nvidia it&s completely okay but you need             to put some money in Innovation as a              long-term              investor you know we are just going        growth is happening and this is not              fluff growth this is real growth which              is happening and lot of Innovation will              happen maybe Nvidia Will Survive not              survive I don&t know but if you&re              betting on innovation in a broad ETF              manner then I don&t      
              under the radar and at that peak nvidia            boasted a valuation of 867 billion            dollars            but it looks like becoming a trillion            dollar company it just wasn&t in the            cards for                  boasted a valuation of 867 billion            dollars            but it looks like becoming a trillion            dollar company it just wasn&t in the            cards for nvidia at the time given that            the    stock has gotten obliterated            in fact since their        peak in november            nvidia has sold off a painful 55 which            correlates to a market cap loss of 480                    requirements to mine they&re forced to             buy extremely powerful hardware and as             you would guess one of their top choices             is nvidia gpus             in the early days miners didn&t really             influence the overall gpu market all             that much as they were a pretty small        called the 3090 and 3090             ti and the launch price of the 3090 ti             is a whopping two thousand dollars this             means that nvidia&s flagship consumer             gpu has risen from seven hundred dollars             to two thousand dollars within five             years             clearly gpu prices have gotten        that investors are             worried about nvidia&s pricing power in             the future             it&s not just    nvidia&s customers that             have been willing to pay any price for             their gpus till recently    nvidia&s             investors were also willing to pay any             price for    nvidia stock in fact i don&t                    think it&s a stretch to say that nvidia             had the rigid valuation        on the entire             stock market for example if we take a                    sps ratio             ran all the way to 26 62             also let&s not forget that tesla is the             most hyped stock on the market but             somehow    nvidia was even more richly             valued despite having far inferior             growth prospects also the recent             sell-off hasn&t made their       even a decline their             current valuation would just become even             less justified causing investors to sell             off the stock even further and don&t             think that just because    nvidia has             already dropped 50 means that they can&t             drop much further because they             definitely can if       
   6  and this week I&m going           to do the same thing I&m making plays on            Sofi I&m making plays on Tesla paler            Nvidia and I&m going to cover all of            these stocks as well as some others in            this video and I have some big news and       around  7 so it            has more than doubled now listen            momentum is a really important factor            and I want to talk about momentum            because this stock keeps hitting new            highs every single day so should you            jump into it well the thing is I have            discussed Sofi in my video on        guys in             my opinion here look the impact of S&amp;P             500 inclusion with Sofi boom baby it&s             going to be like fire the Stock&s going             to Skyrocket like paler did and this is             also going to cause increased liquidity             it&s going to cause attraction of             institutional        show             you everything I&m doing I show you my              1 5 million position on Tesla I&m going             show you my paler position my Nvidia             position I show you every single             position I&m not one of these guys on             YouTube like all all my other             competitors who show you        it for              free on YouTube listen next stock I want              to cover is going to be    Nvidia I&m going              to go into my    Nvidia position    Nvidia has              had a move so I want to give you an              update on what I see happening with                 Nvidia stock listen the    stock I have an              average cost at 137        I want to buy more              Nvidia stock I got some options here as              well that are up about  1,000 I got              covered calls I would        both of              these positions are going to be              completely okay and you can collect some              income on Nvidia and I would say    Nvidia              is a fantastic AI play you can sell puts              to enter the    stock or you can do covered              calls to generate some income on the              shares that you already have       capital to make              about the same amount of Premium so the              only Advantage is when you do a covered              call you get the dividend but Nvidia              really has a few pennies of of dividends              it&s really not that much so it&s really              not something that is a concern to                     don&t gamble if you want to gamble you              know sure put in 1  into smci and see              what happens but in my opinion trash              stock stock is overvalued and it&s going              to go down same thing with mstr I told              folks like listen if you want Bitcoin              just get some      
  Nvidia stock fell down the stairs the 50           Series    stock is going to be really           really tight and it has to be expensive           and AMD was going to charge            900 for their            GPU        filming            it&s down nearly 17 5  which is quite            massive one of the largest drops in            stock market history in single day            trading in case you&re wondering what            did    Nvidia do to make this happen turns            out nothing it actually has to do with            an AI company that                     now this is being disputed the the cost             of training this model could potentially             be higher than that and additionally             they did use nvidia&s gpus so it&s still             not like they&re being taken out of the             picture altogether but at least the             sentiment right now         kind of a knee-jerk reaction at the             moment we don&t give Financial or stock             advice here on the channel so I won&t             comment on the future of what    Nvidia             should be looking like but    Nvidia is the             one behind all of these companies with             their G             according to the        a100 chips             because they stockpiled them before the             export restrictions actually hit so             again Nvidia is involved in every single             sector but uh in case you uh needed to             cash out your    stock it&s going to be a             little less right now in case you&re             looking for a       within the             ballpark of MSRP pricing on these gpus             doesn&t appear to be very high because             multiple reports are coming out that             Nvidia is doing what    Nvidia does which             is squeezing their third-party companies             and making it so that they are very             difficultly making money and that             pricing        it was the same cooler but you             would get an Asus Founders Edition or an             MSI Founders Edition or a gigabyte             Founders Edition but then Nvidia took             control of the founders Edition with the             10 series and the 20 series that             completely changed not just the design             of the        last             Thursday on January 23rd and one of the             reasons they didn&t is because they             actually dropped the price in response             to what Nvidia showcased at CES they             actually had already sold the cards to             retailers for them to put them on store             shelves last week but with         have             been something more sensible because              900 is just absolutely out of the             ballpark of what even makes rational             sense even if you disregard nvidia&s             pricing  900 even an a dzone lineup             doesn&t make a lick of sense it should             have been closer at least in my
