    "original_text": "And I even uh asked this on the 1000XX page today I said NVIDIA or AMD for the next 5 years And my opinion is AMD definitely should outperform that starts in the second half of this year where AMD growth rates at least in my opinion based upon everything I&ve you know NVIDIA stock I&ve owned on and off for years So I know that company very well and AMD obviously I&m a you know now a big shareholder of that company It&s now what the second biggest stock in the public account I believe that AMD is going to start outgrowing NVIDIA revenue-wise in the back half of this year The back half of this year, meaning the third by unusual whales but let&s cover the one stock that&s made them way more money than even that so back in 2022 the Pelos owned a bunch of shares in the chip maker NVIDIA but they sold those shares to avoid any appearance November 2023 her husband bought 2 million worth of NVIDIA options and less than a month later the US announced that NVIDIA could start selling chips to China as long as they met certain restrictions and uh NVIDIA stock went up after that but Pelosi has defended her exercising that right the Pelosi sold just over 2 million worth of Microsoft recently and bought somewhere between 2 million and 10 million in additional NVIDIA shares in two separate recent trades so here&s why the Pelosi might be buying more shares in NVIDIA despite the stock already being up over 2,000 in the past 5 years and their investments from just last November being up over 200 in less than a year so NVIDIA as a stock has looked Unstoppable for the last few years they make the chips required for every new AI service that&s being to build on top of as long as they&re using NVIDIA gpus of course like Mercedes self-driving software or Tesla&s huge investments into NVIDIA AI chips for their cars so even though NVIDIA&s stock price is up around 2600 over the past 5 years the get fined or their future business might get limited which caused those investors to Discount the stock but maybe Pelosi thinks those risks are overblown now NVIDIA is already pretty well covered in the media but we&ll see some much more under the radar stocks kna traded 274 million in that same period so kna is an interesting case in that he&s publicly advocated for a stock trading ban on Congress despite himself reportedly trading hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks he actually did a Reddit ask eight purchases ranging between 15,000 to 250,000 per trade so let&s take a quick look at Barkley&s Bank stock the stock has an average PE ratio for their industry but their Price to Book value and price to tangible Book value which high today following strong earnings also a 10 for one stock split hey maybe it could even push out Tesla and the mag 7 you should be putting yet more money into a broadcom into an NVIDIA into some other AI play this hyper growth phase in probably go on for years broadcom is pretty much giving investors what they wanted something big is happening at broadcom they&re about to do a 10 for one stock split and the stock alone and whenever I see that kind of growth there&s really only one question left to ask could broadcom be the next NVIDIA stock or are their best days already behind them your time is valuable so let&s get right into it first things first I&m custom application specific integrated circuits or as6 it&s important for investors to understand that broadcom&s as6 are fundamentally different from NVIDIA&s gpus at a high level A6 actually have better performance per dollar but at the cost of being much less general purpose after quick clip of Bernstein&s senior semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasin explaining why broadcom might be an even better stock to buy now than AMD which makes gpus that directly compete with NVIDIA a lot of people whenever there&s a boom in something or just a well performing stock love to say well if you miss the you know the the big one go with the next very cheap so brom&s portfolio of data center chips is second only to NVIDIA and there&s this added benefit of diversification since holding NVIDIA stock and broadcom stock means getting exposure to two different kinds of AI accelerators gpus and as6 broadcom helped design every generation of that broadcom is one of the best tech stocks to buy now and hold over the long term broadcom may not be another NVIDIA stock but honestly that&s a good thing too because it&s exposed to all the growth that AI has to offer in a which is why it&s so important to understand the science behind the stocks and if you want to see why I bought NVIDIA stock before it&s 10 for one split check out this video next or if you want to see what stocks I&m watching the ride for the next 3 years in regards to Amazon the third stock I think will do the best out of these a bunch this might come as a surprise to some folks it&s NVIDIA it&s NVIDIA and we&ll get into in just a moment why if I feel that confident about NVIDIA why am I buying AMD stock right now rather than buying NVIDIA right but when it comes to NVIDIA you know a lot of it&s just been drisk now at this point in time you know NVIDIA is now trading at a forward P of Street&s going to have a lot of trouble with trying to figure out NVIDIA&s 2026 growth rates and that&s going to hurt the stock substantially for quite a while right and if you look at NVIDIA stock it&s gone nowhere now for 9 months or so right it&s because no one knows exactly or has any confidence about where NVIDIA&s numbers are going to be for 2026 are we talking a 10 Revenue Growth Company doesn&t mean I&m bearish on them but that leads us to why am I buying AMD stock right now rather than Invidia if I feel like confident well here&s why NVIDIA has their Mi 350 coming out very very soon here okay now what I believe is going to that now additionally when you look at AMD versus NVIDIA you can be you could look at the trailing 12mth p and think like oh AMD looks like a ripoff NVIDIA looks like a great deal okay no you don&t value a stock based upon trailing 12 Monon P you value a stock based upon forward p and twoyear forward P because that&s what really matters from now we&ll be like yeah he was right on like you know didn&t mean a NVIDIA was doomed it just meant AMD was going to do a lot better right for stock I think is going to perform the best out of these seven over the next three years focused on kind of not company specific things they were focused on the markets in general and like what&s going to happen with the stock market that&s what&s going on with individual stocks big big big difference there right but meanwhile AMD announced a big acquisition and this all and so I&ve watched AMD do some Acquisitions here recently and I believe these Acquisitions are to position them to compete directly with NVIDIA over this next 5 to 10 years if not 15 to 20 years out right which I think is very very brilliant in regards to then you think about amds like that next lever up in my opinion of that big opportunity woo I made a lot of money on NVIDIA stock obviously right I don&t own any more shares I&ve sold on my position completely not that I think it&s going to be Acquisitions right they&re likely going to continue to push uh in regards to having the best chips in the world which it seems like NVIDIA will grab the title of like the most impressive chip but then AMD will come back and like they&ll have a new chip and it&s like who this is even more impressive in this way and this way and this way than NVIDIA then NVIDIA will come back and so those two are just going to go at it for years and years and years uh but with that being that are respected now this Intel is Intel is just such a mess that you don&t even have to worry about Intel it&s NVIDIA versus AMD and that&s really it and you can&t really come in and compete with these guys cuz they have the best teams they have the best strategy right now and as long as Jensen&s leading NVIDIA and Lisa Sue is leading AMD I don&t see any anybody being able to come in and really compete with these guys in any in regards to AMD is there a point where I&m not interested in buying AMD shares anymore I would say I would say if NVIDIA goes over 200 I&m good I&m good if AMD goes over 200 I&m good if am AMD if AMD goes to 175 the grocery story I visit huge display obviously for Celsius right there uh this one was quite interesting Walmart Burlington Canada does not even stock it so just show to show you there&s still you know a tremendous amount of opportunity for Celsius International like is hardly even expanded the biggest company on Earth there&s really only one question left to ask is it finally time to sell NVIDIA stock or are its best days still to come your time is valuable so let&s get right into it first things first this video is without getting lucky I&ll talk about the different reasons to sell a stock whether it&s NVIDIA or otherwise I&ll explain exactly who might consider selling NVIDIA stock and why and of course my latest long-term outlook on NVIDIA now that it&s the biggest company on Earth but let me quickly educational purposes only all right let&s start with a few rules to get rich without getting lucky so that we can apply them to NVIDIA stock later in the video the first and most important rule is this the first rule in investment is don&t lose and the second rule rich you know four or five will probably do it over time Warren Buffett did not invest in NVIDIA he missed the boat on Microsoft and he didn&t even buy Apple stock which is his biggest position by far until 2016 when Apple was already worth over half a trillion dollars business interactions per year now uh what who are going to be the winners in AI since this interview tlio is down by 21 while NVIDIA stock is up by over 200 and just to be clear none of this is Kathy Wood&s problem AR invest manages a series of financial shares at least seven times so far and if you&ve been watching this channel over the last 3 years you&ve seen me buy NVIDIA stock over 40 separate times 40 the great thing about dollar cost averaging is being able to buy more shares for the same amount of money of dollars when I bought them that&s big enough to thrive in this economy another reason to sell a stock is that it&s simply overvalued Believe It or Not NVIDIA is still not overvalued you cannot judge this company by price to earnings or price to sales ratios that the for the other stocks in your portfolio but that begs the question why sell NVIDIA stock and the answer has everything to do with the investor the personal part of personal finance NVIDIA grew way faster than every other stock on my list by a lot and it&s more than 10x in the delving deeper into the specific investment opportunities in the AI space and the first talk and question is NVIDIA just to very quickly talk about the performance of NVIDIA as a stock let me first talk about it and then I will speak about whether it is a sensible move to consider something like NVIDIA at this juncture or not so first things first let us look at the stock journey of NVIDIA over the last few months so in the last one month the stock has given 12 5 return almost in six gone up by 170 percent in one year almost like the same performance in the last six months so last six months have been crazy good for something like NVIDIA then comes the natural question that okay is NVIDIA doing something out of the world I try to read a lot about NVIDIA stock honestly I could not find except for the hype that has been built around AI that NVIDIA is providing computational power to AI companies now again please go back to that first half of the video that I was speaking about that where does NVIDIA fit it fits in the hardware space that it is in very simple words providing computational ability to AI based companies if you processor the ability to hold that intellectual property property now all those are intangible benefits that NVIDIA will have going forward but to cut the long story short the stock has already given a 170 run up so from that perspective you are taking a fairly big happen that one is that AMD kind of enough stay sideways or it can rise and become something like NVIDIA in terms of stock price or the NVIDIA stock can fall and come to AMD levels now what story is going to play out what story is not going their most important earnings call ever whether you&re a longtime NVIDIA shareholder or looking to buy NVIDIA stock for the first time you should know that this isn&t just about revenues and profit margins NVIDIA&s earnings decide the speed and the scale of the entire AI Revolution so in this video I&ll break down everything you need to know about NVIDIA&s latest earnings call and what it means for the entire stock market your time is valuable so let&s get right into it to say this was one of the on with Blackwell they&re hugely important Next Generation AI chip I&ll talk about NVIDIA&s biggest risks right now like their supply constraints and their competition and of course what&s in store for NVIDIA stock in the short medium and long term there&s a lot to talk about so let&s Dive Right In to NVIDIA&s most important earnings call NVIDIA posted record revenues of 30 billion for the quarter which is a earnings per share of 68 Which is 171 higher than a year ago after accounting for their 10 for one stock split things get even crazier when we focus on NVIDIA&s data center revenues which now account for about 88 of their total revenues today that&s why I&m not both of which also beat analyst EXP expectations on top of that they issued stronger than expected guidance for the current quarter so why did NVIDIA stock drop 8 after such good earnings well even though their 75 1 gross margins are actually up 5 Points year-over-year they&re down ecosystem has an issue that&s why I spend so much time understanding NVIDIA&s products not just their profits and why I focus on the science behind this stock but credit where credit is due look how fast NVIDIA was able to address this issue with Blackwell and how little it dropped this you know let&s see what happens over the next two quarters but look the no reason for why NVIDIA gained so much like uh in in the stock value after the last quarter it certainly had nothing to do with gaming yeah it was all about they said 11 billion in revenue for the second quarter if you look at the first quarter Revenue it&s just over seven billion dollars and the NVIDIA cut back and I want to be clear I talked to someone at NVIDIA like a a couple weeks ago that said we cannot keep h100 in stock and it will not be in stock for like this is where you know this person was saying this is I mean X is selling very well though I think they&re doing better yeah but very well to AMD and very well to NVIDIA are two completely different things sadly um you know what probably talking that thousands of units difference here we&re not once they&re there once they&re in there and people are you know people corporations are training their abusers on on using like NVIDIA Cuda qdnn it&s very very difficult to shift shift away from that I mean they are the incumbent AMD needs something really on the AI boom Intel yeah I mean comparatively right it&s it&s a complete like it&s funny how like NVIDIA stock price goes up I don&t know how much it went up like what like 20 30 percent or more yeah and then good at ramming into ambulances yeah I mean self-driving cars is a is a definite tough one you&ll notice looking at NVIDIA&s financials that their Automotive Sales are really really going nowhere like they&re stuck below 300 million a quarter so it& 300 video you hinted that while chiplets will let AMD throw more transistors at HPC and AI problems that they are still behind NVIDIA and software at last year&s financial analyst day Victor Pang made an underreported announcement which may have been the most important thing anyways but is it possible to create most the most powerful machine learning chips long term without chiplet technology to me it seems like NVIDIA will still have to put a lot of energy into chiplets soon or AMD can just brute force their way into some market share of NVIDIA sank on Monday crashing over the past two quarters here gaming is expected to fall 33 year over year and the number comes out it&s pretty terrible the chip maker year and the number comes out it&s pretty terrible the chip maker warned in preliminary results that its second quarter Revenue would drop by 19 the stock is rocketed It Up by more than 40 percent over the last few weeks but what that really means is NVIDIA stock is priced for perfect execution and what I&m about to show you is a threat to every part of their business from the power based on what each specific application calls for from PC processors and graphics cards to game consoles and Tesla infotainment systems NVIDIA doesn&t really have anything like that yet which is why their latest Ada Lovelace cards are still monolithic designs and not modular to optimizing for compute power per watt instead of maximizing compute power at any cost like NVIDIA does today and now we&ve come full circle at the start of the episode I said that NVIDIA stock is priced for perfect execution but amd&s chiplet driven designs are posing a serious threat to their PC and data center Solutions if we head over to Simply Wall Street and look at their fair value for NVIDIA which is based on discounted cash flow model we can see that NVIDIA is roughly fairly valued on the other hand if we check out AMD we&ll find that it&s about 40 percent undervalued as I record this that actually means the roughly fairly valued on the other hand if we check out AMD we&ll find that it&s about 40 percent undervalued as I record this that actually means the stock would have to go up by about 70 percent for simply wall Street&s fair value price Target to get reached and if we compare AMD and NVIDIA&s forward price to earnings ratios so using their next 64 while AMD trades at about 37 7 this is what I meant in the beginning of the video when I said that NVIDIA stock is priced based on perfect execution except I just showed you that they&re not executing perfectly at all simply Wall Street is a market share what about further data center Solutions I&m excited to hear your thoughts as for me I do think that NVIDIA stock is in some serious trouble and I&d want to see their price their earnings ratio fall more in line with their peers the company forecasting stronger than expected sales some of the biggest customers of this company are NVIDIA Intel and AMD something crazy is happening at Super Micro computer and smci stock has more than tripled in the last month alone and whenever I see that kind of growth which is right up there with the kind of growth that NVIDIA reported in their most recent quarter I&ve been buying NVIDIA stock since it was well below 200 per share and 400 and 600 but NVIDIA is not the only company growing fast in this massive AI boom Lambda Labs provides other companies with infrastructure for deep learning everything from clusters of NVIDIA&s h200 gpus for specific workloads this building block architecture is what lets smci move so fast in so many different verticals when a company like NVIDIA launches a new chip super micro doesn&t need to design a whole new server system for it they just need to design of course as this ecosystem keeps growing it makes more sense for more data centers to support it smci has building blocks for NVIDIA&s Hopper gpus amd&s epic chips Intel Sapphire Rapids and many more that means super micro can design build test optimize and accelerators and amd&s mi200 and Mi 250 systems and I expect that demand to continue with their next generation of modules for NVIDIA&s upcoming h200 and B100 Blackwell chips their Grace Hopper Super Chips as well as the next generation of amd&s instinct and of the way let&s talk about the right price for smci stock super micro is a great way to gain exposure to the data center Hardware market during this AI boom every time NVIDIA AMD or Intel come out with a new chip super micro designs and I don&t think it&s too late to buy smci stock I would average in over time especially if we see more days where the stock drops by 20 or more I&ve been holding NVIDIA stock since 2016 and I know I&d seriously regret it if I stopped building my position after the stock had tripled I think the same will be true off on kind of what they&re expected for capex now you could look at that as a positive for Guess Who companies like NVIDIA companies like AMD right who do you think is going to reap the most benefit of all that capex additional spending from Google it &s going to be compy it would certainly be NVIDIA number one and then number two would think about as somebody like an AMD right so that&s huge but people don&t like big companies right all the big companies are utilizing AMD sometimes there could be this false assumption that you know if Microsoft&s using NVIDIA like they&re not going to use AMD no that&s not the way it works same thing vice versa they need all these companies they need NVIDIA chips they need AMD chips sometimes they&re for different use cases sometimes it&s similar sometimes it&s more like who can okay they&re in the Penalty Box and I&m not just talking about AMD I&m talking about NVIDIA as well NVIDIA stock has fallen 21 in the past month has NVIDIA come out with earnings in the past month no have they reported some disappointing article news no the only at alltime highs you know all those sorts of things and it&s a true fear but it&s a big bigger fear for NVIDIA than it is AMD cuz AMD is the much smaller player here so they&re the one that and also they&re the ones that versus this year and meta that&s fine as well I&m not losing sleepover at all I would a little bit if I was NVIDIA shareholder because that&s a little you know we&re talking about a different valuation there on that company right and obviously people got so accustomed to these unbelievable growth rates in NVIDIA but as an AMD shareholder I look at this deep sea stuff and I&m like whatever I&m not losing sleep over this I spend on like that would be awesome it&s not realistic they&re going to have to spend year in and year out with NVIDIA with AMD with these companies because guess what they keep coming out with better chips and let&s say you&re you&re Google \">NVIDIA some arm um some Amazon and spy I didn&t get assigned on this oh single actually I think I might have gotten assigned on of like it&s not going to di but the thing is is like I don&t know like I saw like there&s an NVIDIA stock sub and they are just so delusional that like now I&m actually legitimately like oh my dude I can&t get around the tried to avoid fat investing in general I don&t think I stop Baron to be honest they&re not doing Baron and right now NVIDIA is definitely a fad I don&t blame anybody for going into it but a s taunt doesn&t last on me yo thank you again iner your tret has destroyed I said it last time about NVIDIA I never called NVIDIA a fad before I think right now at 3 trillion it&s a fad the last fad that I was looking at sleep in a day I don&t know 8 hours or so is student like right now in the fads I do think that NVIDIA is a fad right now I think the whole Mark General godd damn bad right now but I just I don&t know like over the years and I just kind of dabble with that money in the market oh yeah hell yeah coin flip let&s see how NVIDIA is doing that&s really the question only down 2 I want it to be down I want to be down 5 Sorry video has been an ally has been SL eny kill come on man come on man come on man come on man a oh bro NVIDIA and AMD are getting pounded in the ass your tret has dest okay I really need help like is everybody dead oh my the right any people in the ston market right now what are your positions positions boys positions let&s see Yahoo Finance let&s see how NVIDIA is performing at this very moment Invidia bro it&s kind of funny Yahoo went from like great to \">NVIDIA I mean AMD should be similar Intel&s not doing bad AMD is getting railed too poor AMD people huh a Advanced money Destroyer is like NVIDIA Dow falls again returning to a thousand Point loss that&s cool investors caution against pulling out of stocks no s time to burn your uh shares and devalue the stock they both a crypto crash happen because people lost confidence why they lose confidence Vibes vibes yeah let&s take a look at NVIDIA&s stock you know right here here they are trading at 45 at the uh midpoint of 2023 and then here they are uh with &s very Loosely correlated because it&s all hype sheesh Dam I didn&t realize that back in 2019 the mega Corporation NVIDIA had a combined uh value of asset assets that were 1 uh 30th what they have to what they had uh back in by real world P 500 is erased two times the value of NVIDIA&s uh market cap in 14 days yeah it&s like when people say \">stock stock market volatility happens only after the company reports its earnings or losses doesn&t that indicate that it&s entirely hype driven that you can use to Hype yourself up uh in ways that have nothing to do with your productivity hey guys why has NVIDIA stock gone up 40 times in the past few years is it because they have produced 40 times the amount of good my just saying I really don&t think that&s sort of indicative of the broader Trend how are we on this NVIDIA is actually making a lot more money than they were before I&m not I&m not discounting that but we already know surprisingly complicated question the h100 AI accelerators for 40,000 each really and out of curiosity why are people buying the NVIDIA h100 tensor core GPU just out of curiosity so it&s like an AI chip for data centers or something it&s because investors are super hyped about AI is that so Kev 26 are you suggesting to me that not only is the share price for NVIDIA pretty much entirely hype driven but the massive surgeon profits that they&ve been enjoying in the past two or three years are bigger Revenue acceleration likely in AMD over the next few years and bottom line increase in regards to that percentage as well than NVIDIA okay so when we look at AMD Ford P 27 2-year Ford P which honestly anal assessments are probably way too low 2026 to 2028 but you run those numbers right that puts them at net income margin around 27 which is about half of NVIDIA NVIDIA is running a net income margin right now of like 50 plus per it&s ridiculous right if we run this company if I show that 779,000 gain the 386 don&t let that fool you there&s major gains still coming for the stock this stock is likely going to be 1,000 Plus in 2025 or 2026 is going to hit 1,000 first for the first the market the pin comment down there is going to be an application to get all of my premium courses become Master stock market millionaire Playbook stock options Mastery divid investing Mastery all my best courses ever my premium courses right and plus get access to our incredible that&s got to be impossible 202 how could any stock be beating the stock and then you might say ah I know what the stock is it&s in NVIDIA it&s got to be NVIDIA no it&s not NVIDIA NVIDIA is around the same return profile as paler over the past year so no it&s not NVIDIA you know what stock it is it&s a stock almost no one the past year absolutely trouncing the returns and as somebody that made a lot of money from NVIDIA stock it&s trounced those returns as somebody that&s made incredible gains on paler stock honest has destroyed those returns over the past year 3 148 honest was one of the coming years and I&m about to take you through now it is worth mentioning there&s multiple billionaires that have bought into the stock very recently uh including David teer incredibly successful hedge fund manager arguably the worst owner of an NFL team in the entire league but an amazing hedge fund manager from what I&ve heard he&s bought a lot of shares of stock additionally one of the most genius billionaire individuals in regards to the hospitality industry has been building a significant stake I believe business and AI That&s their main growth engine That&s where the big money is coming from This is why almost everybody is buying NVIDIA stock, this thing right here But they still have three other business lines which are there, which are making money We&ve got gaming They&re well We&ve got professional visualization, architecture, medical design, 3D imaging, and of course, automotive and edge computing, basically NVIDIA self-driving tech Now, nobody&s buying NVIDIA stock because of their self-driving tech Nobody&s buying it because of the gaming stuff People are buying because of this thing This thing is the big bet This is where NVIDIA&s value is coming from This is the same thing why people buy a very interesting development once earnings come in but again it&s dependent on what NVIDIA will show and what Jensen will say everything hinges on that and I&ll explain what I mean so the stock price reaction following the earnings it can literally be the opposite of anything you think intuitively the reports might be good and the stock might come down the reports might be bad and the stock can come up Anything can happen short-term in the stock price I wouldn&t get too obsessed about what&s happening with the NVIDIA price in the 24 hours right after the earnings Okay Now, what do I mean by that"

    "original_text": "Since this video came out is 4x So, ever since that video was made, if you&re watching my channel, I mean, you&ve seen NVIDIA do forex since I said it was the ultimate stock But if you break it down to short-term, you&re going to see that it wasn&t that sweet the are pretty tenured in fact the average manager at NVIDIA has been there for 15 years even if we assumed that they had an entry-level software engineering job the entire time they would have earned about 24,000 per there for 15 years even if we assumed that they had an entry-level software engineering job the entire time they would have earned about 24,000 per year in stock we can even assume that it was only 10 15,00 ,000 per year over 15 years that adds up to 225,000 worth of stock not a bad amount itself but wait until we account for stock growth over the past 10 years NVIDIA stock has grown 200x so even if this employee only held on to less than half of their stock rent over the years or about 100,000 with a 200x return they would now have 20 million worth of just NVIDIA stock and that&s being conservative if they got a few promotions and held on to more of their stock Rand they would be closer to 30 to 50 million and those that were able to with on a daily basis is just a stacked if not far more stacked in fact I bet there&s a lot of NVIDIA Engineers who sold more stock than they needed to for one reason or another and they probably get made fun of by their friends for throwing away a that take Dell for example the company ipoed in 1988 and over the next 12 years the stock would run up a staggering 1200X for a perspective that&s six times more than even NVIDIA over the past 10 years naturally this created a lot of millionaires 27 00 to be precise this sort of mentality trickles down the entire company and this is why you don&t see NVIDIA millionaires buying supercars and mega mansions usually they&re just liquidating small portions of their stock brand to pay off their existing house and build up larger cash reserves it&s almost as if you that&s about 6 billion which basically means 100 of the money that Elon Musk raised in May got dumped into pretty much NVIDIA chips and then of course some CPUs and server racks from Super Micro and Dell maybe accounting for a couple billion dollars along with AI investment and I think that&s the question that is being brought up today and it&s one of the reasons we see NVIDIA stock NOW down 99 3 in fact if you look at the lines right here you can see we ran up into no man& it&s kind of cool it&s a cool tradition uh shout out to the New York Stock Exchange look at that dirty close though NASDAQ 100 Technologies index down 3 04 NVIDIA closes right on Kevin&s line 108 down 9 1 5 Tesla down 162 uh you& thanks bro we built it out now we&re done which means year-over-year returns in the future frankly for companies like AMD NVIDIA Dell and super micro might be really positive for the last last few years but might go super super negative for the years else mentioned the following which leads into my comment sort of on joblessness somebody else left a comment on X and said will NVIDIA really be affected if we are in a recession it&s not like quote unquote people are buying their products and I replied it an infinite Peg because it&s now growing negatively which is in my opinion quite likely don&t get me wrong the cash that NVIDIA has been generating is phenomenal but it just doesn&t last forever then I write the only way to sustain the capex Investments in valuation of companies in trading today look for example here in uh the on the day trade you had upstart burn 99 9 NVIDIA 99 5 mind you this is a huge company A2 2 65 billion company uh this company just burned about 10 that&s over that into your belief as the valuation of these companies I think you might be making a big mistake uh Steve here says NVIDIA closes down 280 billion in biggest one-day loss of market cap in history Kevin gpus are the new CPUs will companies stop buying market that is reacting to the fear that oh my gosh if AI does not prove profitable and at some point the investment stops NVIDIA and the AI bubble will pop and collapse you must in order to continue to evidence or to continue to to justify further continue to invest all the gains like you&ll start to hit your first first run around a 10e period if you look at NVIDIA which is now the number one uh return company um in this sector the everyone put in chat for the last 22 years what has been a return of NVIDIA but if you missed out these last five years you would have missed out on probably 10 or 15,000 per gains you you have to find a way to do right by your audience customer base client base while maximizing profit and this is why NVIDIA Apple meta they are hitting record high because they found a enough of a balance to do that but for he Healthcare companies there is you&re walking by yourself so I mean security detail especially in that position because you&re right when a company like NVIDIA might have a delay on Blackwell it&s like all right that&s a tech inue right or apple has a delay on good I&m replacing Apple out of two te 2 index so you can see that I stand on this business but Apple Microsoft NVIDIA vo vti are the five to invest in if if you want a another company Eli Lily Superstar rockar company great leadership great these company CEOs and you know that&s how you know NVIDIA went up and all of those people that became millionaires because they were employees from NVIDIA that because they had NVIDIA stock not because they Diversified because they had NVIDIA stock and the same thing happened with apple and the same t know how the other ones are going to pan out like I know what the multiple for Apple should be by 2040 and NVIDIA and Microsoft and Vanguard and black rock took over crypto so that&s expanded their portfolio so I think too often times say the right diversification right because if we if we&re talking about like the guys you mentioned Zuckerberg has stock the employee has in NVIDIA but he&s Diversified in companies right so like yes all his nest a wasn&t in apple but Apple&s his out you know what I mean but holding the asset for it like imagine if Kathy would have just held Bitcoin and Tesla and NVIDIA from 2018 what shout out to Kathy s what conviction sounds like when you actually do your and these Mi350 versus Blackwell chips and whatnot, right"
