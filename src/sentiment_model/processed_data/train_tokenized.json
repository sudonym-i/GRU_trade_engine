    "original_text": "Maybe not a thousandx stock, but a 10x stock Right now, keep in mind, we haven&t even everything I&ll cover in this video amd&s latest earnings their next Generation Instinct gpus the biggest risks for AMD stock like competing with NVIDIA and of course where all of this puts AMD on my list of stocks to get rich without getting lucky in 2024 which data center revenues which is up a whopping 122 year-over-year that sounds great at first but let&s compare that to NVIDIA NVIDIA&s data center revenues clocked in at 26 3 billion last quarter which was up by and insane 154 year-over-year and Advance all of the infrastructure all of the logistics and the amount of technology and equipment that came in on that day Nidia NVIDIA&s infrastructure and Computing infrastructure and all that technology to training 19 days just you know you don&t want did anybody sleep are benefiting from this AI boom said another way for every dollar I put into NVIDIA stock 88 cents are directly exposed to AI but for every dollar I put into AMD stock it&s more like 25 to 35 cents that&s a big difference in terms of seriously ramping up hopper and Blackwell production as well as coming out with ethernet-based networking Solutions in fact 3 7 billion of NVIDIA&s Revenue came from AI networking products last quarter which is still more than all of amd&s data center revenues today now units account for almost 50 of amd&s Revenue remember for every dollar I put into NVIDIA stock 88 cents are directly exposed to AI but for every dollar I put into AMD stock it&s more like 25 to 35 that leads me to the third risk for AMD I&m not saying that x86 is going away anytime soon but most major chip designers are leveraging the arm architecture more and more NVIDIA&s grace CPU is arm-based so are Google&s tensor processing units and Microsoft&s Cobalt chips and aws&s graviton amd&s latest earnings their Data Center gpus and the risks of competing with NVIDIA while being spread across many different verticals let&s talk about what that all means for AMD stock and if you feel I&ve earned it consider hitting the like button and and growing faster once I realize that I can get around three times more direct AI exposure for every dollar I spend on NVIDIA stock than I do from AMD it really changed the way I value both companies and this is why it&s so important to highs in your portfolios absolutely incredible this bull runs just marching on I signed up yesterday six six people in the private stock group have hit seven figures in the past week six people like absolutely incredible right another eight people hit six figures plus of don&t think I am NVIDIA look at this NVIDIA falls into correction territory down 10 from its record close folks I show you this cuz this shows you how fast sentiment can shift in the market okay from its record close folks I show you this cuz this shows you how fast sentiment can shift in the market okay right everybody in their Grandma wanted NVIDIA stock 6 months ago going into this year going into last year like everybody wanted NVIDIA like it was the play before it was paler and Tesla it was NVIDIA right everybody wanted NVIDIA and look at this Su stocks now in correction territory while the nasdaq&s blasting off to all-time highs who could ever thought that and did NVIDIA magically report bad numbers no NVIDIA&s last numbers were great when they reported last month the guidance was phenomenal the conference call was phenomenal there it&s absolutely fascinating how that works so you got Bitcoin at all-time highs NASDAQ all-time highs and we got NVIDIA that&s just like doing what like like in correction territory that&s insane right now I don&t know how many you know this will play out again in Tesla this will play out again in pener this will play out again in NVIDIA like it&s just one big game of going through this roller coaster ride of emotions right and you usually know down 20 30 40 50 whatever the way you get through those markets right is you got to be Diversified across growth stock value stocks dividend stocks and you&ve got to own plenty of companies that are very high quality high quality means they last two years look at Monster stock the last two years those haven&t been the play people haven&t want to be an energy drink companies the last couple years no no no no no no they want last two years those haven&t been the play people haven&t want to be an energy drink companies the last couple years no no no no no no they want to be in NVIDIA last two years right an extraordinary how well so many of those dividend and value stocks held up in 2022 what text stocks are just getting obliterated NVIDIA meta go through the whole list they all got wrecked right AMD Netflix Shopify the whole list of them they&re all down the beginning of the firm so every stock in our portfolio has been analyzed with that lens on and to give you the best example of this in our portfolio has been analyzed with that lens on and to give you the best example of this NVIDIA 2014 we owned NVIDIA we were exposed to NVIDIA NVIDIA at that time was a five dollar stock and now it is a four hundred dollar stock five dollars and somewhere in the five to ten billion dollars now AI is a big idea so this is a big reason that I track Arc invest research and their Investments they were buying NVIDIA stock back in 2014 and they were one of the first research firms to realize that gpus would be useful way more than just for example before Tesla made their own self-driving chips they used NVIDIA&s gpus and for years these kinds of applications weren&t priced into NVIDIA&s stock and dark invests spent those years buying the stock for pennies on the dollar but they didn&t keep this information went up because her funds grew overall that&s not the same thing as her buying a specific stock hand over fist like she did with NVIDIA five years ago so this combined AUM number gives us a good Baseline to compare individual positions against so here&s to have happened with some of their biggest positions like Shopify exact sciences and of course NVIDIA Kathy Wood has been catching a lot of heat for selling out of NVIDIA stock right before it tripled in price especially since she&s been such a big investor in them since 2014 and realized that they were such a great AI stock years before most of the market but instead of trillion dollar companies thanks to their app stores and mobile software ecosystems today we&re going through the same kind of pattern NVIDIA is the hardware company capturing a lot of value on the hardware side as we transition from CPUs to gpus or from calculation top of those new devices and the new chips that power them okay so far invest knows this and they&re already selling NVIDIA stock what the heck are they buying to answer that let&s turn to another Quick Clip that I&ve edited down to just going to continue to increase exponentially and CPU performance scaling will never return there is a better way this is Jensen hang NVIDIA&s founder he saw the problem but also the opportunity video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and enthusiasts were also moving away in a different direction towards more powerful dedicated gaming PCs this Market was growing exponentially and NVIDIA found an Ever growing Market selling directly to Consumers but then things went into overdrive their Flagship GPU the GTX 1080 TI in so why did GPU Skyrocket in price well it turns out that video games are only one part of the story in total NVIDIA stock has grown by over 300,000 to over 3 trillion and looking closer most of that growth happened in the last 7 Cisco did end up Surviving the slaughter but to this day 24 years later Cisco stock has yet to recover to their Doom Peak so what does this have to do with NVIDIA just because one company crashed doesn&t mean that another will well let&s like AT&amp;T and Intel have P ratios of 10 to be blunt NVIDIA is a house of cards their stock price is way overvalued for their revenue and earnings since late 2022 NVIDIA&s Revenue has overd doubled but their valuation has 13x largely due to speculation and perceived value as opposed to fundamentals and the reality is that NVIDIA will have an extremely similar to Cisco in 2000 and I&m not the only one who&s noticed Jensen hang himself is anxious about NVIDIA following the same path NVIDIA&s stock has gotten far ahead of itself it&s become fragile overvalued and doesn&t reflect the company&s revenue or profits and as such I think NVIDIA has reached its peak or is very very close to it last time I made in better hands but here&s the thing even with a 70 crash NVIDIA would be worth an astonishing 1 trillion so this isn&t anti- NVIDIA it&s just anti- their stock price so let&s see what happens let me know in the comments if stock price increases you will lose money so we&ll look at an example of that right now and for this example we&re gonna look at a put option trade in Invidia gonna look at a put option trade in Invidia and obviously this trades gonna lose money because who is buying puts in invidia who is betting against NVIDIA did end up surging higher and therefore the put options price collapsed and in the most recent date on this chart we can see that NVIDIA stock price was at around three hundred and twenty one dollars over 40 00 higher than the put options strike price of two hundred and meaning that it was essentially worthless so if a trader bought this put option for 700 and they held it until the expiration when NVIDIA was three hundred and twenty dollars or higher they would have lost the entire 1100 premium that they paid for this put option because a put option you would have much less risk buying a put option compared to shorting 100 shares of stock so in this NVIDIA example if I shorted a hundred shares of stock at 280 dollars per share and the share price went to 320 I would have a loss of 4, option that has a further expiration date will be trading with significantly more extrinsic value because there&s lots more time left for the stock price to move and therefore cause the option to become significantly more valuable particularly intrinsically valuable now the IWM put that we looked intelidox shares has been significantly higher on every single trading day as compared to visa shares for example on May 14th the high to low stock price range in visa meaning the highest price of the shares subtracting the lowest price of the shares on that trading day was somewhere will make money from a decrease or shrinking in the valuations of those options and you can do so without any change in the stock price or without any passage of time because implied volatility changing literally means that the option prices are changing and really important changes profit on this is currently 33 hundred dollars in 16 days that was 16 days ago so this option has almost doubled in price because NVIDIA has been screaming higher and I own this call option so this is a big increase in the options price and this is a little week NVIDIA&s Market hit a trillion dollar valuation they joined that elusive trillionaire club with apple Microsoft Google and Amazon they&ve come back a little bit but they&re Microsoft Google and Amazon they&ve come back a little bit but they&re still right up there with the five companies that are responsible for 96 of the entire stock market&s 500 stocks in the s p 5500 there are really only five stocks that matter the 495 other stocks combined have essentially returned zero and we all know why NVIDIA right now we&ve uh we&ve seen the very early days of what could surely turn into an AI bubble but NVIDIA can&t be the only stock out there right they have to have some competition some other companies that are going to make the backbone of this today on Don money we found them and we&re going to tell you what and how we&re investing in the next NVIDIA yeah stock this is dumb money live hey there Dave here along with Chris and Jordan we are done money welcome to dumb money live coolest thing I&ve ever seen and the one thing that all of these things have in common is that the running on NVIDIA gpus so it&s no surprise that NVIDIA stock is up to 100 this year uh and our goal here to uh today is to identify the next NVIDIA and I know you guys have stock picks so let&s get right into it yeah Dave there&s something else that all of these um companies that are adopting AI have in common besides just utilizing NVIDIA&s gpus most if not all have very different servers right they have uh very different high-speed Network architecture everything about the next-gen data center is different so NVIDIA is kind of the most obvious piece of that new gen data center but certainly not the only piece and I think that the &s right um and Taiwan City is just sitting at a comfortable like 15 p e um and they produce everything that NVIDIA designs so NVIDIA is just a uh they&re just an IP company yeah and software but um TSM actually produces these things great great PE earlier today The West Bank remains a major flash point in the Israel Palestine conflict Hamas has called the move an annexation project NVIDIA stock surge shows no sign of slowing The chipmaker has become the world&s most valuable company Its market value crossed 3 4 trillion today like some biblical savior In fact, the company&s earnings are now being tracked in watch parties How about that"

    "original_text": "No, doesn&t work like that So, you know, cuz it&s a whole it&s a whole different phenomenon in regards to what&s going on with NVIDIA right now So, but you know, I think there will there are risk involved with NVIDIA a lot of the gains that you already have so this is the most important week for NVIDIA and look mark my words what&s going to happen is NVIDIA will beat earnings but the stock won&t rise too much because expectations already baked in I&m going to show you a &s more investors looking to buy calls that&s because there&s more Bulls on NVIDIA than Bears that&s very interesting and that&s one of the warning signs that I have for a stock that may be reaching a peak and that&s why I said that you know basically mark my words I think that NVIDIA will have good earnings but it won&t rise more than 10 and that blind to when a stock pulls back that&s not me I&m always looking for upside opportunity but I&m also looking for pullbacks I&m also looking to hedge and I&m looking to be for upside opportunity but I&m also looking for pullbacks I&m also looking to hedge and I&m looking to be smart with my money right so when it comes to NVIDIA I have a few call right away that cash enters your account immediately however now you may lose your shares if the stock goes above the strike price right so in this example or this position if NVIDIA were to go to 150 155 I would lose my shares I don&t want that so I the call option so there is a whole lot more call options and I am bullish on NVIDIA I do think expectations are priced then so when we do get the good earnings the stock will go up but it&s not going to pop up like huge amounts okay I&d be happy if it does don&t get me wrong if NVIDIA goes to 160 170 great but that is not what I the longer term I would say that it is smarter to buy uh an option on NVIDIA to really get in behind NVIDIA and to ride ride the earnings drift to ride the momentum to ride the stock uh you know performing very well so you can see how the implied volatility here on so I would buy the 130 okay this will be about 2800 which is much better than paying 4,000 or 155,000 for NVIDIA stock if you were to buy 100 shares it&s a lot better actually so this is a lot cheaper it&s like a very small button below and start experiencing the benefits as I shared with you in in the introduction NVIDIA stock is down by over 15 on the back of this news NVIDIA stock has lost hundreds of billions of dollars of market capitalization in just one day in fact if trillion large numbers indeed and it highlights the riskiness of investing in tech stocks like NVIDIA of course I&m disappointed in this development because I&ve had NVIDIA stock rated as one of my top stocks to buy in 2025 in fact I had it rated as a top stock to buy last year as well 2025 is getting off to a rough start for NVIDIA stock investors but why is NVIDIA stock down by so much today well the semiconductor Market is leading a cash flows are threatened and if you remember when I did my discounted cash flow valuation of NVIDIA part of the reason why investors are so attracted to NVIDIA stock is because because its free cash flows are expected to Surge over the next decade rising from business is forecast to grow over these next 5 years over these next 10 years so given this decline NVIDIA stock is now trading at a forward price to earnings of 27 which signals to me that it&s still undervalued additionally if you look at my discounted cash flow valuation model NVIDIA stock still looks relatively cheap compared to my intrinsic value per share calculation which forecasts that NVIDIA is free cash flows will grow significantly over the next decade and more and the longer term and even in that scenario it&s intrinsic value would be 270 per share so what&s my conclusion is NVIDIA stock a buy on this dip is this a buying opportunity well I think it&s too soon to come to the conclusion that downside and so this downside reaction I think is an overreaction to this news but it does bring me to higher alert on NVIDIA stock I&m already paying close attention to Amazon Microsoft and all these companies that are spending money on data centers and the recent it&s too soon to make any kind of conclusive change in my recommendation so I&m still reiterating that I still think NVIDIA stock is a buy but put a asterisk there to be more cautious because the big tech companies Microsoft Amazon alphabet will be rep m convinced that Wall Street still doesn&t understand NVIDIA whether you&re a longtime shareholder or you&re thinking about buying NVIDIA stock for the first time you should know that this earnings call wasn&t about revenues or profit margins NVIDIA just showed us why it&s the king of the entire AI era so in this video I&ll break down everything you need to know about NVIDIA&s latest earnings and what that means for NVIDIA stock in 2025 and beyond your time is valuable so let&s get right into it as always I&m data centers I&ll walk you through a few things that most investors still don&t understand about NVIDIA&s data center gpus I&ll share my thoughts on NVIDIA stock and whether I&d still buy it now that it&s the biggest company on Earth by market cap and of course where NVIDIA will end the year on my list of stocks to get rich without getting posted earnings per share of 78 cents which is up 11 from last year after accounting for their 10 for one stock split this past summer NVIDIA&s data center segment is their biggest business unit by far accounting for about 88 of their total revenues today another sits on top of that but now that you understand it at least at a high level we can talk about the future of NVIDIA stock and if you feel I&ve earned it consider hitting the like button and subscribing to the channel that really helps me out like this thanks and with that out of the way here&s what I think is in store for NVIDIA stock in 2025 and Beyond like I said earlier I think NVIDIA will be the world&s first 4 trillion company their revenue and earnings are still growing by triple that will change the way that companies invest in Computing in the first place just like NVIDIA is doing right now by disrupting the CPU Market with their gpus on top of that NVIDIA stock is still relatively cheap with a forward price to earnings ratio lower than their two main competitors broadcom and AMD as fast as their stock price has gone up their earnings have gone up much faster a bigger company a more successful company uh to like be a successful stock and that&s just not how this works at all AMD does not have to beat NVIDIA AMD has to be a competitor of NVIDIA and compete hard in the markets but they don&t have to beat the next 3 years uh or the next 5 years we could even say for instance I wouldn&t be surprised if if NVIDIA does fine as a stock but I wouldn&t be surprised if AMD is like that Beast opportunity a much bigger percentage Gainer over this next 3 to 5 years I think AMD is blow NVIDIA out of the water when as as somebody that was an NVIDIA shareholder in the past right made a lot of money on that stock last year right I&m completely out of position now and the reason being is not because I don&t think there&s money to be made in NVIDIA that&s it&s definitely possible NVIDIA can grow into a 5 trillion doll under a 200 billion dollar market cap which that makes AMD a big Tech stock it&s just not part of the trillion dollar boys club that you know we all think about as meta Apple Microsoft NVIDIA Amazon those sorts of companies right but in my personal opinion based upon all the growth I see for AMD over the next few years I believe this stock price is going to increase dramatically by 2030 and I just looking at it from a simple standpoint of like oh it doubled oh it went up a lot is bad no different than NVIDIA NVIDIA stock if you look at those 2022 lows it did the first then double up in early 2023 right so it does a quick 2x there and soon enough we&re going to lose more and more of course NVIDIA is the poster boy of the bubble right now it will pop once it pops the bubble ends the stock market will crash and you will never see the highs for decades and there are similarities and I thought it was a subject that is worth exploring the recent action that we&ve seen in NVIDIA and many other stocks specifically really large Camp stocks brought back memories of 1999 the famous Y2K rally and the headline year 22 we&ve seen normalization of net profit it went down to about 4 billion so we&ve seen the stock of NVIDIA peaking in 21 then crashing down in the year 22 because it was a reflection what the company&s going to produce cares about margins if they go higher stocks go higher the margins go down stocks go down suppose these were the conditions of NVIDIA before 23 then we got the AI Mania all of a sudden we have large companies stampeding to develop their AI capabilities because now investors are putting a higher price on AI they can&t do without NVIDIA&s advanced chips which Nidia by the way had these chips since 22 it was already in the inventory the pricing was increasing Demand with lack of Supply pricing goes higher the combination of all of these things makes margins explode higher with it NVIDIA stock also exploded higher what usually happens after that and we&ve seen that with Cisco to maintain this demand to serve this the economy interest rates recession consumer demand goes down this feedback now reaches these big companies who are buying the chips from NVIDIA they begin to see that their numbers are going down because of the weakness of the economy so they stopped they pulled almost 37 Google was up almost 42 Apple 2007 was up almost over 120 Research In Motion AKA Blackberry was the equivalent of NVIDIA today that stack was up almost over 140 Amazon up more than 140 you see the concentration of gains in the technology sector gaining some momentum and if you&re a momentum Trader you&re probably chasing those kind of names you&re switching from NVIDIA to Taiwan for example there are 7 million ways to benefit from bubbles there are those who chase them stop at the going through ELF and everything that&s massive going on there, we&re going to talk about NVIDIA, the stock that matters more than pretty much any other in regards to the whole entire stock market, right"

    "original_text": "and saved me the most heartache is this when in doubt zoom out that means don&t just look at near-term Price action yes NVIDIA stock is down 20 over the last month but it&s still up by over 450 in the last 2 years and 70 in the last year alone and if you actually look at this price chart for more than a second you&ll see that NVIDIA stock has actually dropped by 20 three other times over the past year that&s basically once per quarter now let me show you a of the same price chart except this time it&s showing Enid&s draw Downs the top of this chart is 0 which means NVIDIA stock reached a new high and was 0 off of its peak everything below zero is how far the price has dropped from that Peak it&s dropped by 30 12 separate times which means it had to recover by almost 50 to reach a new high all 12 times NVIDIA stock dropped by 50 five separate times which means it needed to double all five times just to break even and it crashed by 80 break even and it did recover but it took over 5 years just in time for the Global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 where NVIDIA stock fell by over 80 again except this time instead of hitting a new high after half a decade it was still down by around to finally put my money where my mouth was and make videos explaining why I disagreed then in the summer of 2022 when when NVIDIA stock hit the same price as when they first announced their a100 gpus and kathywood was still selling it I decided to call it quits on to earnings ratio is near a 5year low making this a dip I&m happy to buy and before I share my current outlook on NVIDIA stock here are a couple more quick tips that really help me out as a full-time investor first doing nothing is usually a great option right answer is doing nothing and time in the market beats timing the market have helped me stay in and even double down on NVIDIA stock and paler stock and many other great stocks that I cover each week speaking of which I said I&d tell you my latest long-term demand Trump&s tariffs might cause some short-term pain but they&re not a serious long-term concern and Jensen Wong will keep selling NVIDIA stock as he should but as long as those sales are tiny fractions of his overall Holdings and they&re automated the scary headlines will do you got to be flipping my flapjacks have a look at that folks NVIDIA stock price down 177 in one trading day and the company didn&t even come out with earnings the damage was extensive here today Oracle price down 177 in one trading day and the company didn&t even come out with earnings the damage was extensive here today Oracle stock down 14 percentage points here today broadcom which doesn&t get talked got got some sub subjects to speak about here today first off I&m going to share my thoughts on NVIDIA is this a buy the dip opportunity on this stock what&s going on here I&ll share all my in-depth thoughts on this one SM has been these opportunities pass by year after year after year right all right so here&s a deal folks NVIDIA now if you don&t know my history around NVIDIA I owned the stock many years ago I bought it kind of like the end of 2018 going into 2019 it was incredible opportunity at that time a lot of tech stocks were getting the hammered right I made some short-term money on NVIDIA and sold out then I owned the stock in 2024 made a bunch more short-term money I think I made like 50 or something crazy on get cut in half or more which means there could be 50 plus downside in NVIDIA stock but before you run to that conclusion you know be careful running to that conclusion right because if NVIDIA keeps growing and growing like that&s never that&s not going to happen right you&re going to have to pay such a crazy premium because also everybody&s confused on what&s going to happen here with NVIDIA stock over the next few weeks or the next couple months and so therefore if you buy call options or put options you&re probably of your profitability so the moral of story is I don&t want to do anything with NVIDIA nothing is interesting to me in regards to NVIDIA at the moment if maybe the stock Falls a ton more then maybe it&s interesting as a buy for me right um if today like you you look at the nasdaq&s a disaster today you&re looking at NVIDIA the most important stock in the stock market for the past two and a half years uh the stock down 17 in the day and yet meta was like oh oh what happened oh oh now the reason I believe there&s very limited downside risk in AMD so obviously we spoke about NVIDIA it&s like yeah if NVIDIA blah blah blah happens you know could the stock fall 50 plus per there definitely a potential I think there&s very limited downside potential in the most powerful AI chips on the planet almost every AI service runs on NVIDIA&s infrastructure today but after announcing a 10 for one stock split on one of the best earnings calls in recent Market history NVIDIA stock blew past 11,000 per share and whenever I see that kind of growth there&s really only one question left to ask is this finally the top for NVIDIA stock or are their best days still to come your time is valuable so let&s get right into it first things first I&m not their competition and Supply constraints and of course what I&m doing with my NVIDIA stock as a result especially with a 10 for one stock split on the horizon all right let&s Dive Right into to NVIDIA&s earnings NVIDIA posted record revenues of 26 billion for the quarter which is 18 higher points year-over-year see what I mean about these year-over-year numbers this crazy growth is why NVIDIA stock is actually cheaper today than it was a year ago wait the stock is cheaper now even though it&s near all-time highs let me show you what I&m talking 180 over the past year but their earnings per share Rose by 650 which means NVIDIA&s price to earnings ratio is around three times lower today than it was a year ago in fact fact NVIDIA stock is trading right around its 5-year average price to earnings ratio even though it &s growing much faster today and has much higher margins now you know why NVIDIA stock is actually cheaper today even though it&s at all-time highs you probably also know that vpn&s protect you and your online data thanks and with that out of the way let&s talk about the risks to holding NVIDIA stock which surprise surprise really means the risks to their Data Center business let&s start with their competition NVIDIA has two kinds of competition chip makers like AMD and Intel and hyperscalers that make their ethernet-based networking Solutions and their price to earnings ratio falling over time I&m going to keep buying NVIDIA stock to get rich without getting lucky so congratulations to my fellow NVIDIA shareholders and thanks for watching until next time this is ticker symbol U my name is Alex reminding you that Intel would always be considered amd&s two main rivals or two main competitors right so 100,000 into NVIDIA stock 10 years ago is now worth 26 million which is ridiculous right 100,000 into AMD is worth 4 6 million so I understand 4 6 million is not 26 million but who&s beat a NVIDIA stock in the past 10 years like NVIDIA stock might be the best performing 10year stock in the entire stock market like it&s a one1 freak situation I&m sorry but 100,000 into 4 Revenue year that&s pretty darn impressive like what she&s doing here is very very impressive now that shows you the performance of NVIDIA over time right and how their revenue is trended over time but what about recently wow we had some very important things going on here recently I have to show you guys there&s basically four segments of NVIDIA&s business there two entree businesses which are the big dogs right and there&s two side dish businesses what we&re looking accelerating and accelerating for several years in a row it usually means great things for the stock price it&s usually a very fun time to be an investor of that company now NVIDIA went through that cycle where their their revenue kept accelerating accelerating unfortunately that&s now over for NVIDIA so NVIDIA is kind of unfortunately for them they&ve entered a no fund stage the no fund stage doesn&t mean you can&t make money in the stock it&s just it&s harder to get the gains because now people start looking at the revenue growth and it keeps going down on a percentage basis right so NVIDIA next year maybe they grow Revenue I mean AMD is going to be the hot one that everybody&s going to want to flock to because they got the accelerating growth in NVIDIA unfortunately will have the decelerating growth rates quite substantially especially over this next two years now right now another thing we need to just have no serious competitors at that point in time AMD is really the only company in the whole Marketplace who can really give NVIDIA competition at this point in time right so the moral story is there&s there&s ways to play this if you&re to give you a different frame of mind I want to actually pin it against the big dog NVIDIA the most respected company in the space right and you know NVIDIA stock I&ve obviously made tremendous amount of money on this over this past year right I&m completely out of my NVIDIA position now at this point in time but there&s a reason I&m buying AMD over NVIDIA right now because s another frame of thought to think about right this is from the Q4 2022 bottom right since that time NVIDIA stock is up 1,100 AMD is up 140 NVIDIA 100 deserves the the the move it&s made here some people call that a bubble not if to be played in 2025 2026 and into 2027 when it comes to AMD stock versus NVIDIA and I&m not necessarily thinking that NVIDIA is going to crash and it&s like oh my gosh NVIDIA&s like down 50 or something crazy right I just believe amd&s 2025 and 2026 are going to be the years of AMD like I said not like it&s impossible to make money on NVIDIA stock over the next few years but I just believe like like kind of I would look at it the same as you looked at the last two years in regards to NVIDIA vers AMD last 2 years it&s like could you have made money in AMD sure there was some money to be made but where there was a huge money to be made it was to be made in NVIDIA right NVIDIA got out there first they got their AI chips in the market first they beat AMD at the punch AMD you know lagging in regards to that right now it&s catchup time and so I believe the big money is going to be made in AMD stock over this next couple years versus NVIDIA because you&re going to have the emetic growth you&re going to have the gaming get back to growth overall and so overall I think you&re going to see 25 26 really be the years of AMD versus the years of NVIDIA right and once again that&s not saying there&s not money to be made there now I believe so you might say through that in this video here today look at Telsa stock this stock Falling Again big here today 40 the stock has now fallen since December 18th a pretty dramatic fall even by Tesla standards headlines all over CNBC talking about NVIDIA this NVIDIA that NVIDIA sales growth 78 in AI demand company when he gives strong guidance and what does the stock have to show for it a whole lot of nothing right it was funny I was headed what stocks are set up to do very well which ones are not set up to do very well okay so NVIDIA I posted this inside the private stock group Discord chat under the income statements tab here&s a deal income statement looks great that should come as no surprise everybody in the stock market knew NVIDIA&s income statement was going to be great like there was no question the issue is this is a grade A income statement not everybody knows about it there&s no like secret here in regards to NVIDIA like oh I never knew this about no no everybody knows everything in regard NVIDIA every wall streer knows it it&s the most studied stock probably in the market because it&s been so talked about the last two years so the rating on the wall was here in regards to NVIDIA where essentially the company was in a 2026 is a year where you&re going to see major deceleration and so the problem with NVIDIA stock here is do people want to step in knowing you&ve got massive deceleration coming in NVIDIA as early as you know third quarter or fourth quarter of this year and that&s the issue people don&t want to step in when you got a stock that has decelerating you know we&re going to have chips power the entire AI Revolution from self-driving cars and humanoid robots to large language models and the supercomputers that train them but NVIDIA stock has been crashing hard going down 20 in just the last 2 weeks and whenever I see that kind of collapse there&s really only one question left to ask is this the end for NVIDIA stock or are there best days still to come your time is valuable so let&s get right into it first things first I&m not here to waste your time so here&s everything I&m going to cover why NVIDIA stock is crashing right now I&ll share some really important Market data that long-term investors need to understand and of course my latest their Skyhigh 75 gross margins and their quickly expanding total addressable Market as more kinds of companies adopt accelerated Computing as a result NVIDIA stock is up by over 1,000 in the last 2 years and up by over 100 year-to date even after this latest drop given why it&s so important to understand the science behind the stocks So based on everything I just covered here&s my latest outlook on NVIDIA stock and if you feel I&ve earned it consider hitting the like button and subscribing to the channel that really helps me out and it 2024 that&s a 32 compound annual growth rate for 25 years straight crushing the returns of the S&amp;P 500 and remember even though NVIDIA stock is down by over 20 in the last few weeks it&s still trading at around 100 per share so you&d actually have off its peak everything below zero shows how far it&s dropped and how long it took to recover and make a new high so NVIDIA stock has corrected by 10 or more 31 separate times or once every 10 months on average it&s crashed by 20 or more 18 separate times not including this one or the one from last month that&s a full-on crash of NVIDIA stock every 17 months on average it crashed by over 30 11 of those times which means that it had to recover by almost 50 right as I&m recording this video but don&t forget that volatility swings both ways a little over 1 month ago on July 31st NVIDIA stock had its Best Day Ever it added a whopping 329 billion in Val value and went up 133 in a single day as a do overall yeah so nbdl is very simply the 2x NVIDIA ETF in other words it is a leverage single stock ETF that&s designed to provide two times the return the daily return of NVIDIA stock stock so as of today obviously very much the talking point of the market um maybe maybe the entire stock market uh as NVIDIA has just released its earnings and then of course when it a friend at the New York Stock Exchange as well it doesn&t really get any better than that we&ll put the link in the chat here momentarily we&re about eight minutes or so away from Exchange as well it doesn&t really get any better than that we&ll put the link in the chat here momentarily we&re about eight minutes or so away from NVIDIA&s earnings calls don&t go National Institute of advanced industrial science and technology is building its AI bridging Cloud infrastructure 3 0 supercomputer with NVIDIA We Believe Sovereign AI Revenue will reach low double digigit billions this year the Enterprise AI wave is started Enterprises also drove sequential to build custom llama 3 1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications NVIDIA Nims accelerate and simplify model deployment companies across Healthcare energy Financial Services Retail transportation and Telecommunications are thriving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit Solutions at the consumer at the computer vision and pattern recognition conference NVIDIA won the autonomous Grand Challenge in the end to end driving at scale category outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide Boston Dynamics be slows developers must must accelerate everything possible accelerated Computing starts with Cuda X libraries new libraries open new markets for NVIDIA we released many new libraries including could accelerate polers pandas and Spark the leading data science and data processing libraries CVS for Vector yearly of csp&s cloud capacity and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in Sovereign AI infrastructure and NVIDIA Ai and NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI General Robotics and now the Enterprise AI wave has started and earnings we&ll be taking a look at the full numbers here giving a breakdown segment by segment and why the stock is going down even though NVIDIA beat on both the earnings per share and the revenue Salesforce also reported today this is one of the companies I own it was and how these earnings have affected my performance now let&s first go ahead and jump into the headline news here NVIDIA just reported earnings and so far the stock has been bouncing around up and down a little bit but overall in the red in the red from anywhere of 3 150 increase year-over-year so they beat their expectations but we still get a muted response from investors so what does this mean for NVIDIA why are investors becoming less enthused about this stock why is it trading down when they beat on every metric possible I believe it&s because &re reporting and the expectations are becoming closer and closer together meaning that the alpha in the stock is becoming more and more narrow the earnings reports are becoming more muted expectations of NVIDIA are now so close to what they&re actually reporting that it&s difficult to find as much a high starting valuation that&s more likely to lead to multiple compression than expansion if we rewind time 3 years ago NVIDIA was in the best situation the stock had accelerating Revenue growth in fact massively accelerating Revenue growth it had margins expanding and it had a low starting valuation everything down they started with a 78 gross margin which is down 3 quarter over quarter so I don&t say any of this to bash NVIDIA stock I think it&s one of the most incredible companies in the market today and it&s one of the most amazing Stories over the are pricing in but we can say definitively with this report that the upside in the stock today is far less than it was a year ago the future expected returns are far lower NVIDIA will trade closer to expectations and it&ll be harder to get gains out of this company when I look at the earnings reports of any of these companies with Salesforce and crowd strike they seem rather mundane NVIDIA seems to be the most shocking one that the stock isn&t going crazy after earnings and I think that&s the single biggest development of this earning season up Okay, so the knock valuation, the knock speculation What about the knock of concentration"

    "original_text": "Super Bowl, NBA, and now NVIDIA earnings s time for vantage shots Images to their hardw news recap for the week we have a good episode for you today first up the stock of the 50 Series or the lack of it secondly the stock of NVIDIA it fell two and a half Nestle in value additionally Intel Nova Lake getting some disclosures in one of to slow the ability uh to restock quickly other than whatever is in the sort of in the shipping queue already and it appears like NVIDIA really wasn&t prepared for this launch uh and ultimately it just sort of increases consumer frustration across the board with the 5090 launch especially all right next one while on the topic of NVIDIA&s cards video cards notes that the 570 TI now has a date attached to it the claim states that reviews are coming out February 474 grams his GitHub page on the screen has more information it&s not meant to be a tutorial but it is a fun project NVIDIA had a hell of a week the company experienced a record setting drop of 50089 billion in market cap it was a big enough AI models that it claims to be comparable to other AI models NVIDIA stock took a dive this announcement ultimately led to what appears to be Panic selling from NVIDIA&s shareholders interestingly enough deep seek actually trains their llms on NVIDIA gpus from what we&ve seen so far the 589 billion decrease 52nd largest US company depending on the day you look at the market cap listing moves around but Nestle stands at roughly 222 billion so NVIDIA&s decrease in a single day was worth over two and a half Nestle if you want to learn more arbitrary and probably completely pointless &re not experts in you can subscribe to our newsletter arbitrary and useless facts about the stock market newsletter for some additional perspective Forbes which probably does know something about the stock market maybe notes quote NVIDIA&s nearly 600 billion market cap loss Monday is larger than the individual Market losses of post was quote the market reaction is wrong lowering the cost of AI will expand the market Galer said that today he&s an NVIDIA and an AI stock buyer and is happy to benefit from the lower prices but Tom&s Hardware also pointed out in a separate post that users doubled this year or more but and this is a big one that Marquee arcfont missed out on that jaw-dropping rally in NVIDIA which she exited entirely in early January in that Flagship fund let&s get an inside look joining us now is kathywood herself yeah so we started our research on artificial intelligence actually when we were studying the possibility of autonomous vehicles way back in 2014 NVIDIA at the time was five dollars that&s on the split basis five dollars now it&s closing in on 450 so we wrote way more than the other stocks that she&s been selling out of so it&s clear that Kathy Wood is using NVIDIA stock as more of a cash position now and selling it to buy other stocks that she feels are undervalued but what stocks our portfolio the companies have proprietary data that no one else has so Kathy is this as good as it gets for NVIDIA or are you looking for an opportunity to pick back up some shares sure if it were to correct it goes through these revenue and videos focused on hardware for every dollar of Hardware AI will pull through probably eight dollars of software so again NVIDIA really important Cornerstone stock has from five dollars to four hundred and fifty dollars done a lot of work and now people understand it&s on these are the same kind of stocks that Kathy Wood has been buying with her profits from NVIDIA stock alright but now that we can see just how much NVIDIA stock has skyrocketed over the last few months I think it&s fair to ask whether Kathy would regret Deirdre up front actually not actually not you know what we moved into more Tesla more coinbase those are up as much as NVIDIA so we&re I&m a portfolio manager we&re managing a portfolio and when we see one valuation Skyrocket and other valuations research their stock picks and even the timing of some of their traits but one thing we should never be doing as investors is dismissing it when somebody makes a boatload of we should never be doing as investors is dismissing it when somebody makes a boatload of money and that&s exactly what Kathy Wood has been doing with NVIDIA stock and coinbase stock before that and Tesla stock before that we should always be making data-driven decisions and the best part is Arc invest publishes their research the key to finding great stocks is understanding a company&s products not just their profits and I&m convinced that NVIDIA will be bigger than Apple bigger than Microsoft and NVIDIA stock will sit on top of the indexes as the biggest company on Earth let me show you why your time things that investors need to know about Blackwell&s design costs and margins the networking technologies that NVIDIA built to scale Blackwell data centers to mindboggling sizes and of course whether I&m buying NVIDIA stock as a result and where I&d put it on the list that I made at the start of the year to get rich without getting lucky but let me point out a few quick things before I dive into NVIDIA&s insane new Blackwell gpus to wait 10 years to find the next iPhone or hold the next Apple stock that&s why I&m making these videos now all right one last point and then I&ll dive right into NVIDIA&s Hardware I get asked all the time how I make these videos and I Blackwell data centers to do anything Humanity can throw at it now with all of that context let&s talk about whether I would buy NVIDIA stock at today&s prices and if you feel I&ve earned it consider hitting the like button and subscribing to the channel that really helps out more deep Dives like this thanks and with that out of the way let&s talk about NVIDIA stock I think that Blackwell is about to move the needle in a big way for NVIDIA black Blackwell is not just a new data center GPU it&s an entire compute platform chips self-driving Cars Smart factories and even humanoid robots all of which I&ll cover over the next few videos because I really believe that NVIDIA stock will sit at the top of the indexes and Pension funds and everyone&s portfolios for years to come so with everything I&ve learned 900 per share I also ended up moving Amazon stock up one spot since AWS is the biggest cloud service provider on the planet and I think that their Bedrock platform for generative AI is about to benefit since AWS is the biggest cloud service provider on the planet and I think that their Bedrock platform for generative AI is about to benefit a lot from NVIDIA&s Blackwell gpus this is why it&s so important flip my flapjacks a little bit and uh made 11,500 plus dollars on NVIDIA stock in the public account And then through my other portfolios as well, ended up making multi5 figures on NVIDIA stock last year But NVIDIA was really just the appetizer We&re about to get into the main course I&m going to make multi6 figures on AMD stock and I believe it&s going to be a tremendous Now, that can compete against Intel in some ways In in other ways, it&s going to be competing much more heavily against NVIDIA over the coming years Okay"
