    "original_text": "But to, you know, sit on your hands and and not be interested in this stock is just, it&s kind of crazy , man It&s kind of crazy And so, um, you know, the futures are looking very good for both those companies long term in my opinion AMD and NVIDIA I just think there&s based spend at least as much as they thought they were going to spend, if not more Doesn&t take a genius to figure out NVIDIA is going to come through with great numbers I just watched Jensen today on CNBC He looked as confident as ever So, what engineering just is a giant mess and trickery so as I understand they went below Cuda so they go super low programming of gpus effectively NVIDIA builds this Library called nickel right uh in which you know when you&re training a model you have all these communications between every single and they would flip back and forth between them and this requires extremely low-level programming this is what nickel does automatically or other NVIDIA libraries handle this automatically usually yeah exactly and so so technically they&re using you know PTX which is like sort of like you Etc but they have a lot of computer can you in general actually just zoom out and also talk about the the hopper architecture the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and the difference between h100 and h800 like you mentioned the interconnects yeah so there&s you know Amper was the might subsidize them and therefore if AI takes a long time to become differentiated we&ve knapped the financial performance of American companies NVIDIA can sell less tsmc cannot sell to China so therefore we have less demand to therefore in to like keep driving the production cycle so to design any chips I&m just going to contra manufacturer chips for else other people um and one of their early customers is NVIDIA right NVIDIA was is is the only Semiconductor Company uh that&s worth you know that&s doing more than a billion dollars of Revenue that it possible since they&re a hedge fund that they timed everything with this release and the pricing and and they have they shorted in NVIDIA stock and stock of USA companies and released it with star like just perfect timing to be able to make money like they&ve released it on and cheaper and cheaper the the big deep seek R1 release freaked everybody out because of the cheaper one of the manifestations of that is NVIDIA stock plummeted uh can you explain what happened I mean and also just explain this moment and whether you know if a straight line up right and and there&s been so many different narratives that have been trying to push down NVIDIA not I don&t say push down NVIDIA stock everyone is looking for a reason to sell or to be worried right um you know it was it&s it training and inference but it&s important to understand that smci does not make their own chips instead they take chips from companies like NVIDIA AMD and Intel and integrate them into their own data center infrastructure adding Power Electronics cooling networking Solutions and software depending the mind-blowing speed of standing up this super cluster was only possible because Elon Musk used super micro&s liquid cooling modules for NVIDIA&s H1 100 gpus Elon is also deploying super micro Solutions at massive scales in supercomputers over at Tesla which are used to train Tesla centers onto their Hardware ecosystem while they still have a massive performance advantage over their competitors that&s why it currently appears that NVIDIA is routing orders away from Super Micro and to their other partners which also seems to be backed up by Charles leang saying that that they&re not receiving enough NVIDIA chips to fulfill their backlog of orders so even if super micro does regain compliance and stays listed on the NASDAQ which isn&t guaranteed this whole regain compliance and stays listed on the NASDAQ which isn&t guaranteed this whole situ ation could further erode institutional confidence in Holding smci stock and that means lower trading volume less access to Capital and increased borrowing costs on top of that NVIDIA can keep rerouting orders until they&re sure that super micro fixed all of their on the flip side my guess is that this will impact NVIDIA&s overall sales and earnings and we may seen some short-term pain since expectations for NVIDIA&s performance are always so high but even if NVIDIA stock does drop my stance is the same today as it&s been for the last 3 years NVIDIA is the most powerful AI company on Earth with the best management team on Earth and the stock will perform accordingly over time NVIDIA&s next earnings call usually less than 20 and a crash is a decline of 20 or more so for example the NASDAQ is currently in a correction while NVIDIA stock is crashing all right here&s a chart of every Bull and Bear Market since 1956 with the recessions Shaded in Gray on this that&s a 32 compound annual growth rate for 25 years straight absolutely crushing the returns of the S&amp;P 500 and remember even though NVIDIA stock is down by 20 over the last month it&s still trading at over 100 per share so your 10,000 from 1999 would actually be worth around 12 million today if you could have held it that long I&ve been holding NVIDIA stock for over 8 years and it&s been one of the most difficult things I&ve ever done here&s another version of took to recover before making a new high said another way this chart shows every dip correction and crack that NVIDIA has ever had so let&s count them up NVIDIA stock has corrected by 10 or more 31 separate times that&s once every 10 months on average it&s crashed by 20 or more 18 separate times not including this one that means NVIDIA stock has a full-on crash every 17 months on average it&s crashed by over 30 11 of those times which means it had 85 over the next year and 2 years later you were still down by by 80 it took NVIDIA over 5 years to recover just in time for the global financial crisis where NVIDIA stock fell over 80 again except this time instead of recovering after 5 years it was still down by around 70 it ended up taking 9 years for NVIDIA stock to make a new high nine years my point is these two price charts are actually the same chart which means investors can&t get because they have quarterly numbers that they need to hit but don&t forget volatility swings both ways just last week on July 31st 2024 NVIDIA stock had its single Best Day Ever it added a whopping 3029 billion in value going up 133 in one day as a 3 trillion me and I showed you historical data on the depth and length of Corrections and crashes for the S&amp;P 500 as well as NVIDIA stock now that we&re on the same page about the context let me tell you what I&m doing now that everyone seems to Jensen hang just delivered a crazy keynote at computex and I&m convinced that Wall Street does not understand NVIDIA NVIDIA is now bigger than Apple and the stock has more than tripled over the last year alone so it&s easy to assume that this has to be the top but the key to finding great stocks is understanding a company&s products not just their profits and after this keynote I&m convinced that NVIDIA 2026 I&ll break down NVIDIA&s inference microservices or Nims for AI model deployment and then I&ll cover NVIDIA Omniverse their platform for digital Twins and simulations at massive scales and of course what all of this means for Omniverse their platform for digital Twins and simulations at massive scales and of course what all of this means for NVIDIA stock as a result but let me point out a few quick things before I dive into NVIDIA&s brand new gpus first NVIDIA is not just a hardware company they&re an endtoend AI Computing chip switches like NV link and rack Tock networking Solutions like infiniband or Spectrum X that&s the bottom layer of NVIDIA&s Stack NVIDIA&s Cuda ecosystem and acceleration libraries sit on top of that at a high level this part of the stack enables accelerated individual Nims as building blocks as well but there&s one more software platform in particular that you should know about and that&s NVIDIA&s Omniverse no not the metaverse people actually like this one Omniverse is a 3D simulation platform that lets artists designers engineers and processing and artificial intelligence which can be broken down into different acceleration libraries software packages and now Nims that are powered by NVIDIA&s CPUs gpus and networking Solutions that&s how everything fits together and why upgrades and Innovations in any one part of the this thanks and with that out of the way let&s talk about NVIDIA&s stock at the time of this recording NVIDIA has a bigger market cap than Apple and I personally believe that NVIDIA will be bigger than Microsoft by the end of the year for all of that going to software not just Hardware so for me this is a long-term investment I&ve been buying NVIDIA stock well before the split and I&ll be buying it long after the split as well and if the riskier but still very solid bet on the future of AI okay now for stock number four I&m gonna go with another stock here that I consider to be relatively medium risk and that&s going to be NVIDIA ticker symbol nvda who unlike the other companies that we&ve talked about so far NVIDIA is much more focused on the processing power that will be needed for AI as well as some of the software infrastructure too but on the hardware side NVIDIA develops the world&s highest performance graphical processing chips otherwise known as gpus that can process giant amounts of data at extremely fast speeds more than 70 percent of the fastest super computers on Earth too and like I said it&s not just on the hard Hardware site NVIDIA also has some of the best AI software in the world including an autonomous driving platform that is already used by nearly 400 different Logistics Public Safety sanitation transportation and a lot more much of that is actually video being collected and processed which is the specialty of NVIDIA gpus there&s also their Omniverse platform that not only helps companies integrate into the metaverse but it also takes real world environments and transforms biggest forms of entertainment in the metaverse OR cryptocurrencies which will likely be one of the most used forms of currency as well well NVIDIA they their chips are always being used for both high performance gaming as well as cryptocurrency mining all of these various markets have so much future your potential that NVIDIA estimates that their total addressable Market will be worth over a trillion dollars yet they&re only doing about 27 billion in sales for the 2022 fiscal year so that&s like 27 times larger of a growth opportunity and yet because of the current economy and market conditions NVIDIA stock has experienced a Monumental crash this past year losing more than half of its entire value long term though I still think it&ll be you can at least develop a perspective and also a very quick note that if you have been noticing in the stock market then companies like NVIDIA have grown massively in the last few months which shows that these corporate companies are making a lot of money on is what is being said that Chinese have kind of reverse engineered the whole thing and as a result what happened was that NVIDIA right which is what which does what well it supplies computing power to both openi and hopefully in the future we Supply it to 20 21 in the last 2 days so then comes the natural question that okay computing power has improved then why did the NVIDIA stock fall so this is a note that I had written on the member community so in case you are interested I had explained it quite extensively on my member Community wrote multiple post I mean it will give you more clarity so NVIDIA used to supply certain kind of more expensive chips which typically used to cost 35,000 plus each now due to the advancement in being led by Deep seek the AI can be trained on much cheaper chips now you will come naturally then should we invest in NVIDIA right now or not see this is a guess work because multiple stories can be built here the positive story is that see this is like overall advancement in AI a lot of local startups will come they will also seek support from companies like NVIDIA there will be more demand of chips because they will try to build the next version of Deep Sea story to is that a lot of structures right or the next leg of experiments that they were running for developing commercial applications of AI based on NVIDIA Hardware structures now the assessment is yeah maybe we don&t they don&t require this Hardware structure anymore so this was a opportunity number three you have to bet on Innovation right it&s fine right I mean if you are considering to wait on NVIDIA it&s completely okay but you need to put some money in Innovation as a long-term investor you know we are just going growth is happening and this is not fluff growth this is real growth which is happening and lot of Innovation will happen maybe NVIDIA Will Survive not survive I don&t know but if you&re betting on innovation in a broad ETF manner then I don&t under the radar and at that peak NVIDIA boasted a valuation of 867 billion dollars but it looks like becoming a trillion dollar company it just wasn&t in the cards for boasted a valuation of 867 billion dollars but it looks like becoming a trillion dollar company it just wasn&t in the cards for NVIDIA at the time given that the stock has gotten obliterated in fact since their peak in november NVIDIA has sold off a painful 55 which correlates to a market cap loss of 480 requirements to mine they&re forced to buy extremely powerful hardware and as you would guess one of their top choices is NVIDIA gpus in the early days miners didn&t really influence the overall gpu market all that much as they were a pretty small called the 3090 and 3090 ti and the launch price of the 3090 ti is a whopping two thousand dollars this means that NVIDIA&s flagship consumer gpu has risen from seven hundred dollars to two thousand dollars within five years clearly gpu prices have gotten that investors are worried about NVIDIA&s pricing power in the future it&s not just NVIDIA&s customers that have been willing to pay any price for their gpus till recently NVIDIA&s investors were also willing to pay any price for NVIDIA stock in fact i don&t think it&s a stretch to say that NVIDIA had the rigid valuation on the entire stock market for example if we take a sps ratio ran all the way to 26 62 also let&s not forget that tesla is the most hyped stock on the market but somehow NVIDIA was even more richly valued despite having far inferior growth prospects also the recent sell-off hasn&t made their even a decline their current valuation would just become even less justified causing investors to sell off the stock even further and don&t think that just because NVIDIA has already dropped 50 means that they can&t drop much further because they definitely can if over 7 just in the past five trading days oh boy The Q&s by the way just think of it as the NASDAQ NVIDIA stock our fearless leader oh our fearless leader is giving up on us uh down 8 1 2 on great earnings you know great guidance stuff right but uh it&s never enough It&s never enough and that stock down 8 and a half here today look at this NVIDIA is now down over 11 since mid June June okay is now down over 11 since mid June June okay stock has gone nowhere for quite a while despite the numbers being very good meanwhile oh I get this now NVIDIA right NVIDIA they couldn&t understand it they didn&t know what was going on and then when they came to buy NVIDIA boy did they come to buy NVIDIA and that&s why you see all and a stock go up 2x in in 6 months and you&re like how has this stock just went up 2x in 6 months and the very entertaining right uh I saw this comment yesterday and uh made me feel very good about AMD stock you know with a name like that I&d rather be an NVIDIA than AMD like you know if they don&t know the difference between then and then you&re out there I call them right so I put 50,000 in uh this particular account bought a bunch Bunch AMD stock bought cheesecake stock bought elf stock bought Anna stock bought Celsius Celsius and Celsius and Celsius right now Celsius you know is they&re just going through kind of stock here fell over 65 right and you could say this stock sucks it&s the worst stock ever it&s a falling knife it&s a garbage stock right that stock I&m showing you right there you know what stock that is that&s the leader of the stock market the fearless leader that is NVIDIA the stock fell over 65 from where it was Q4 2021 to Q4 2022 it was a falling knife it was a garbage stock guess what everybody that bought this stock on this whole dip whether you&re numbers recent news and why i expect them to grow thank you to weeble for sponsoring this video let&s get started so the first stock on my list is pubmatic stocktickerpm pubmatic is an advertising company that basically connects publishers with advertisers so that advertisers year has nearly doubled in price at the beginning of november the company announced earnings that blew analyst expectations out of the water so the stock consequently skyrocketed by 20 percent the next day clubmatic specifically reported year-over-year revenue growth of 54 a year-over-year net income in demand for the foreseeable future i&m definitely going to be putting this company on my shortlist all right next up we have NVIDIA stock ticker nvda NVIDIA is an american tech company that is known for designing graphics processing units as well as chip units that are used in electronic devices such as gaming consoles and pcs right now one share of NVIDIA is trading at 315 3 cents with a 52-week low of 115 67 and a 52-week high of 346 4 their one-year they have a five year expected peg ratio of three point three eight and a price book ratio of thirty three point three five so NVIDIA very recently hit a new all-time high price and its entire history on the market after reporting a 50 year of your growth last earnings call and when we revisit the price street of the company&s stock ever since its ipo we can see that NVIDIA has experienced really great growth for the past two decades this is because NVIDIA caters to not one but several large markets that have been growing rapidly for gpus can accommodate production of more advanced computers showcasing NVIDIA&s ability and influence to enhance the markets and business that accompany it and if anything the speculation and hype surrounding these ada lovelace gpus enhance the markets and business that accompany it and if anything the speculation and hype surrounding these ada lovelace gpus will be a good sign for NVIDIA stock and the fact that i see gaming becoming more and more mainstream with the metaverse adding to that NVIDIA has been a consistent winner ever since it went public and since i started talking about diversion so we&ll get into like how it was made as well but yeah so you know as he was saying uh NVIDIA high high-end GPUs are banned from sale in China because they don&t want them to be catching up in the AI race yeah so NVIDIA in response and I worked there when they were doing this made a nerfed version of their H100 that is like slightly worse that version after they banned it before they got to sell it but after they spent billions making it got banned and so NVIDIA stock yesterday huge drop huge drop because that was very expensive to make and now they can&t sell it again and so there& means is it is using a GPU to do a \">NVIDIA is so valuable because fundamentally it&s just a lot of linear algebra it&s machine learning it&s a giant machine learning a GPU to run on but if you give it the GPU then yeah you&re good when I used to work at NVIDIA I used to have to do all that by hand all the math equations all the linear algebra sent to me and much all that has been in seven tech stocks at the top it&s been the magnificent seven of Apple and you got NVIDIA you got Apple you got the metals company you got pretty soon and everybody&s favorite company Tesla tesla should not be in again totally makes sense but like there&s a real argument that everything over the past two or three years of all these stock market games is just a giant AI inflationary thing i don&t know whether it&s a bubble but it is certainly probably s what we don&t know but that that&s where we could be headed i have a counter point i think even NVIDIA who makes the GPUs that runs the AI I think they&re more safe because I don&t think that something like maybe not but regardless of whether people are using GPT7 or Deepseek 5 they need a GPU to run AI so for me NVIDIA is still go like I I don&t know if their valuation is is good it&s probably over inflated but they& t disappear they just got cut to 10 and then have grown slowly back to where they are i cuz that&s where NVIDIA&s big profit comes from is like them needing to get 10 better so they got to buy if those companies stop yeah NVIDIA stock fell down the stairs the 50 Series stock is going to be really really tight and it has to be expensive and AMD was going to charge 900 for their GPU filming it&s down nearly 17 5 which is quite massive one of the largest drops in stock market history in single day trading in case you&re wondering what did NVIDIA do to make this happen turns out nothing it actually has to do with an AI company that now this is being disputed the the cost of training this model could potentially be higher than that and additionally they did use NVIDIA&s gpus so it&s still not like they&re being taken out of the picture altogether but at least the sentiment right now kind of a knee-jerk reaction at the moment we don&t give Financial or stock advice here on the channel so I won&t comment on the future of what NVIDIA should be looking like but NVIDIA is the one behind all of these companies with their G according to the a100 chips because they stockpiled them before the export restrictions actually hit so again NVIDIA is involved in every single sector but uh in case you uh needed to cash out your stock it&s going to be a little less right now in case you&re looking for a within the ballpark of MSRP pricing on these gpus doesn&t appear to be very high because multiple reports are coming out that NVIDIA is doing what NVIDIA does which is squeezing their third-party companies and making it so that they are very difficultly making money and that pricing it was the same cooler but you would get an Asus Founders Edition or an MSI Founders Edition or a gigabyte Founders Edition but then NVIDIA took control of the founders Edition with the 10 series and the 20 series that completely changed not just the design of the last Thursday on January 23rd and one of the reasons they didn&t is because they actually dropped the price in response to what NVIDIA showcased at CES they actually had already sold the cards to retailers for them to put them on store shelves last week but with have been something more sensible because 900 is just absolutely out of the ballpark of what even makes rational sense even if you disregard NVIDIA&s pricing 900 even an a dzone lineup doesn&t make a lick of sense it should have been closer at least in my &nbsp;' + subcountp + '&nbsp; ' + data"
