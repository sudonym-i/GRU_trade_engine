# ML Trading Bot

This project is an automated trading bot that uses deep learning to predict future stock prices and make trading decisions.

## How it Works

- **Data Loading:**
    - Downloads historical price data for tickers specified in `config.json` using Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`).
    - Adds technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD) to the data for richer feature representation.
    - Data is split into sequences of configurable length for time series prediction.

- **Machine Learning Model:**
    - The core model is a multi-layer Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network implemented in PyTorch (`nn/model.py`).
        - 3 GRU layers, 128 hidden units each
        - Two fully connected layers (64 units, then 1 output)
        - SiLU (Swish) activation function
        - Dropout (0.2) after the first fully connected layer for regularization
        - Trained to predict the next closing price given a sequence of past prices and indicators

- **Training:**
    - Model is trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Adam optimizer.
    - Training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc.) are set in `train_nn.json`.

- **Trading Logic:**
    - For each time step, the model predicts the next price.
    - **Buy** if prediction > current price (or hold if already holding)
    - **Sell** if prediction < current price
    - The bot currently trades the entire portfolio (all-in/all-out, no position sizing)

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.json` to set:

- `tickers`: List of stock symbols
- `start`, `end`: Date range for historical data
- `seq_length`: Number of time steps in each input sequence
- `interval`: Data frequency (e.g., '1d')
- `epochs`, `batch_size`, `lr`: Training hyperparameters

## Limitations

- The trading strategy is intentionally simple and does not account for transaction costs, slippage, or risk management.
- The model does not use advanced portfolio optimization or reinforcement learning (yet).
