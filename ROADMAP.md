# ML Trading Bot Project Roadmap

## 1. Project Setup
- Set up a Python virtual environment.
- Install required libraries: PyTorch, pandas, numpy, yfinance (or other data source), matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.
- Organize the project structure (src/, data/, notebooks/, etc.).

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Choose target stocks and timeframes.
- Download historical stock data (e.g., with yfinance).
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize features).
- Engineer features (technical indicators, moving averages, etc.).
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

## 3. Model Design
- Define the problem (classification: up/down, regression: price prediction, or RL: trading actions).
- Design neural network architecture (MLP, LSTM, CNN, or hybrid).
- Implement the model in PyTorch.

## 4. Training Pipeline
- Set up data loaders and batching.
- Define loss function and optimizer.
- Implement training and validation loops.
- Add logging and checkpointing.

## 5. Evaluation & Backtesting
- Evaluate model performance on test data.
- Implement backtesting logic to simulate trading with historical data.
- Analyze results (returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc.).

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Experiment with different architectures, learning rates, batch sizes, etc.
- Use validation results to guide tuning.

## 7. Deployment & Automation
- Package the model for inference.
- (Optional) Set up a live trading or paper trading environment.
- Automate data fetching, prediction, and order execution.

## 8. Documentation & Reporting
- Document code and project structure.
- Write a report or notebook summarizing findings and results.
